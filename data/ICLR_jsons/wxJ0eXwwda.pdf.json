This document contains the following content: * We add more analysis for token distribution shift. (Fig. 1 & Fig. 2) * We merge the two ICL steps into one. Now, the URIAL only uses one ICL step and becomes more efficient without decreasing performance. (Sec 1. Fig 3) * We enlarge the test dataset to 1K examples and refine the metric (Sec. 2). * We re-evaluate all methods and present more results to show the effectiveness of URIAL in order to address reviewers\u2019 concerns. We also include three case studies. (Sec. 3. Tab. 1. Fig. 5.)

Figure 1: More pairs of base-aligned LLMs for token distribution shift analysis. We present the percentages and also the most frequent shifted tokens. Base Rank of Aligned Tokens Position \u00e0 KL Divergence Base Prob. of Aligned Tokens The lower value here means P_base and P_aligned are more similar to each other at t. The aligned token ot is the token decoded by aligned LLMs via greedy decoding (thus with max P_aligned value) at each position. We plot its probability inside P_base. We here plot the rank of aligned token inside the list of tokens predicted by Base LLMs (ranked by P_base). Base Rank \u03b7 = 0 means the aligned token is also the top-ranked token decoded by Base LLM. Figure 2: Empirical analysis for token distribution shifts on Llama2-7b (base vs chat). 1 UPDATED METHOD: URIAL AS A SINGLE-PASS ICL FOR ALIGNMENT Previously, there is an optional ICL step named contrastive alignment (CA), which adds inference cost. Suggested by reviewers, we merge the CA step into the first ICL stage by adding the system 1 This pdf is the concatenation of rebuttal pdf (Page 1-7) and the original full paper (Page 8-27).",

Our system prompt is inspired by the Llama-2-chat\u2019s, but we use it for ICL on base LLMs that are not fine-tuned at all.\nTo limit the number of tokens for the prefix, we use K=3 examples by default for URIAL. Apart from the two examples shown in Figure 3, there is another query about role-playing and suggestions, \u2018You are a detective interrogating a suspect. How do you get them to confess without violating their rights?\u2019 Therefore, in total, we have three examples: one for safety, one for information seeking, and one for role-playing.

Figure 4 shows the statistics and categories (7 task types and 7 topics).\nRefined evaluation.

When using Mistral-7B as the base model, URIAL (4.63) outperforms its official SFTed model, Mistral-7BInstruct (4.44), on all aspects, yielding the best performance on 7B-level LLMs. Likewise, on top of Llama-2-70bq , URIAL also outperforms the RLHFed version (Llama-2-70b-chatq) by a large margin (4.74 vs 4.67), which almost matches the performance of ChatGPT (4.75) and GPT-4 (4.8). Note that Mistral-7b and Llama-2-70bq are both better pre-trained than Llama-2-7b, as suggested by various benchmarking results and the zero-shot performance (e.g., helpfulness 3.05 vs 3.70).\nWhat if we use fewer or more in-context examples for URIAL? In the above analysis, we mainly talk about the performance of URIAL with K=3 in-context examples. For testing K=1, we keep only the \u2018renewable energy\u2019 example in Fig. 3; For K=8, we add one example for each of the following topics: math, coding, poem writing, procedure and safety. Using a single shot, URIALK=1 with Llama-2-70bq can also achieve a satisfactory overall performance (4.62) with a better \u00f2 helpfulness (4.60) than the RLHFed model. If we use K=8 examples that are 2k tokens, we find it significantly improves the \u00e9 safety for Llama-2-7b (4.29\u21924.97), but there is performance drop on all other aspects. On Mistral-7B, URIALK=8 also has a better \u00e9 safety and engagement score. Therefore,\neven though URIALK=8 has a better or similar overall performance than URIALK=3 for Llama-2-7b, we recommend URIALK=3 for its balanced performance and lower inference cost.

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant improvements due to alignment tuning, that is, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on instruction data and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This raises questions about what is precisely learned during the alignment tuning process. We investigate the effects of alignment tuning through the lens of token distribution shift between untuned LLMs and their aligned counterparts (e.g., Llama-2 versus Llama2-Chat). Our findings reveal that most distribution changes lie in stylistic tokens (e.g., transitional words, discourse markers), suggesting that LLMs primarily learn the language style of AI assistants during alignment tuning, while most of useful knowledge has been acquired by untuned LLMs. Thus, we pose the question: Is it necessary to update model weights to attain LLM alignment? Based on these insights, we propose an alternative method, Untuned LLMs with Restyled In-context Alignment (URIAL), which achieves effective alignment solely through in-context learning (ICL) with as few as three curated, stylistic examples. Our evaluation on diverse examples from LIMA and AlpacaEval demonstrates that URIAL can achieve highly satisfactory performance, sometimes equaling or surpassing SFT+RLHF counterparts, especially when the untuned LLM is sufficiently pretrained. This implies that fine-tuning may not be as always crucial as previously assumed for LLM alignment, and lightweight alignment methods like URIAL hold promise for efficiently tailoring LLM behavior without fine-tuning. 1\n1 INTRODUCTION\nFigure 1: Tuning-based alignment (SFT + RLHF) is expensive and time-consuming. In contrast, URIAL only requires a few curated, stylistic examples for in-context learning.\nA few curated stylistic examples\nIn-Context\nSFT+RLHF\nUntuned LLM URIAL\nTuning\nAligned Assistant\nAlignment tuning has led to remarkable improvements in large language models (LLMs), sometimes seemingly unlocking impressive capabilities (Bubeck et al., 2023). This fascinating progress raises the question of what precisely happens to LLMs before and after alignment tuning and whether there might be a way to reduce the cost and complexity of LLM alignment by gaining deeper insights into this tuning process.\nUntuned LLMs, obtained from pre-training on extensive text corpora, typically lack the ability to generate responses that align well with user instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022). Alignment tuning refines untuned LLMs into responsible AI assistants that generate responses favored by humans. Current alignment-tuning approaches primarily rely on two stages: supervised fine-tuning on instruction data (SFT) (Taori et al., 2023) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Bai et al., 2022). SFT and RLHF have been considered necessary for alignment tuning (Touvron et al., 2023). However, it is crucial to understand what untuned LLMs learn from alignment tuning. Do we really need to perform SFT or RLHF to achieve our goals? Can we obtain similar effects without updating model weights?\n1Our code and data will be publicly accessible at:\nMotivated by these questions, we investigate the effects of alignment tuning and compare the token distributions between an alignment-tuned LLM and its untuned counterpart (Sec. 2). Surprisingly, the most significant differences predominantly occur in stylistic tokens (e.g., \u2018Hello\u2019, \u2018Thank\u2019, \u2018However\u2019, etc.), which form transitional words and discourse markers, rather than content-bearing words. This observation strongly supports the superficial alignment hypothesis (Zhou et al., 2023), suggesting that most of the useful knowledge is already acquired during pre-training and alignment tuning primarily involves learning the language style of AI assistants such as ChatGPT.\nInspired by these insights, we propose an alternative alignment method called URIAL (Untuned LLMs with Restyled In-context ALignment), which effectively aligns untuned LLMs without updating their weights (Sec. 3). URIAL leverages templated prompting and in-context learning (ICL) by using just a few carefully curated, stylistic examples to achieve impressive alignment. We curate the in-context examples such that they typically begin with confirming the user query and introducing background information, then proceed to list items or steps with comprehensive details, and finally conclude with an engaging summary that includes safety-related disclaimers. We find that incorporating these stylistic modifications in in-context examples can significantly improve the relevance, coherence, factuality, and depth of the responses. Furthermore, an additional ICL step can reinforce the alignment by restyling the initial responses to adhere more closely to human preferences, particularly in terms of safety and engagement. Deployment of URIAL is both easy and lightweight since it utilizes the same K in-context examples (approximately 1k tokens when K=3) for all test cases without modifying untuned LLMs. Inference speed can be further optimized by pre-caching these tokens and applying context compression methods (Mu et al., 2023).\nTo rigorously evaluate URIAL, we design a multifaceted and verifiable GPT4-based evaluation protocol (Sec. 4) on 500 diverse examples from LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023) and AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023). Our analysis covers six aspects of LLM outputs: \u00f2 relevance, \u00ee coherence, \u00a7 factuality, \u00db depth, engagement, and \u00e9 safety. We provide explainable justifications for each aspect that human annotators can verify. Remarkably, the results show that URIAL, with as few as three well-written examples, effectively aligns untuned LLMs to achieve highly satisfactory performance, sometimes equalling or surpassing SFT+RLHF aligned LLMs, particularly on Llama-2-70B.\nSpecifically, in scoring-based evaluation, URIAL can achieve an overall score of 9.17 (out of 10) by aligning untuned Llama-2-70B, while its SFT+RLHFed counterpart, Llama-2-70B-Chat, achieves 9.13. (For comparison, ChatGPT gets 9.49 and GPT-4 attains 9.53). Pairwise comparisons show that both Llama-2-70B-Chat and URIAL achieve high win-or-tie rates with ChatGPT \u2014 they both can outperform or match ChatGPT\u2019s performance in 91.8% of the examples.\nIn conclusion, our analysis and results indicate that conventional alignment tuning methods (i.e., SFT + RLHF) may not be as crucial as we previously assumed, at least within the scope of our evaluation. It is also noteworthy that alignment tuning could potentially cause catastrophic forgetting issues. For instance, Wang et al. (2023) demonstrate that applying SFT to Llama-13B with selfinstruct data (Wang et al., 2022a) results in a significant decrease in its MMLU performance (from 42.5 to 30.3) and Codex-Eval performance (from 26.6 to 13.4). Shen et al. (2023) argue that reward models in RLHF can exhibit high inconsistency, resulting in near-random performance when presented with contrastive instructions. Considering the limitations of tuning-based alignment methods and the efficacy of URIAL, we believe it is promising to explore efficient, lightweight alignment methods that tailor the behavior of LLMs without fine-tuning (Lu et al., 2023)."

In this paper, we use the terms \u201cuntuned LLMs\u201d and \u201cbase LLMs\u201d interchangeably to refer to LLMs that have been pre-trained on large corpora without any subsequent tuning using instruction data. We denote a base LLM as f(x; \u03b8), where x is the input context and \u03b8 represents the set of parameters that generate the next token. The \u201calignment tuning\u201d process tunes the parameters \u03b8 of a base model f to create a more assistant-like model g(x;\u03b2) that adheres to user instructions and human preferences. This process typically comprises two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on instruction data and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). During the SFT stage, the base LLM is fine-tuned using instruction-answer pairs through a process known as \u201cinstruction tuning.\u201d In the RLHF stage, a reward model further refines the SFT-enhanced model, resulting in better alignment with human expectations in terms of helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness."

            "text": "Motivation. To understand the learning process during alignment tuning and the differences between aligned and untuned models, we analyze the token distribution changes between the two. Specifically, for a given user query q = {q1, q2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 }, we input it into the aligned model g(x) to obtain its output o = {o1, o2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 } via greedy decoding. For each position t, we define a \u2018context\u2019 at this position to be xt = q+ {o1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ot\u22121}. We denote the aligned model\u2019s probability distribution for predicting the next token of this position as Palign, where ot has the highest probability.\nOur analysis is driven by the question: What happens if we switch to the base model for decoding the next token at this position? By passing xt into the untuned model f , we generate another probability distribution, Pbase, for sampling the next token at this position. If the base model learns to modify its behavior in this context through alignment tuning, we should observe a distribution shift between Pbase and Palign at this position. On the other hand, if the two distributions are very similar, it implies that alignment tuning has minimal impact on this position.\nShifted positions. Analyzing the difference between two distributions across the entire token vocabulary is challenging, particularly when sampling is enabled for decoding. As illustrated in Figure 2, the aligned model g with greedy decoding is first used to generate a full output o. For each position t, tokens are ranked according to their probability Pbase as predicted by the base model f . The rank of ot in this sorted list is defined as the \u2018base rank\u2019, denoted as \u03b7. This results in three types of positions: (1) unshifted positions (\u03b7 = 1): ot is the top-ranked token in both Pbase and Palign, having the highest probability; (2) marginal positions (1 < \u03b7 \u2264 3): although ot is not the top-ranked token in Pbase, it is still likely to be sampled for decoding, with the 2nd or 3rd highest probability. (3) shifted positions (\u03b7 > 3): in this case, ot is rather unlikely to be sampled by Pbase, indicating a significant distribution shift from Pbase to Palign."

            "text": "Knowledge-intensive content originates from untuned LLMs. Consider the real example in Figure 2, where we use llama-2-7b and llama-2-7b-chat as a pair of base and aligned models. We can clearly see that most knowledge-intensive words, including the key answer \u201cChihuahua\u201d and related information such as its weight and length, appear at unshifted positions. On average, across 1k examples that we tested, 78.9% of tokens are at such unshifted positions, which increases to 93% when including marginal positions. This observation suggests that untuned and aligned LLMs share the same pre-existing knowledge from pre-training, such that a proper prefix can trigger this acquired knowledge without tuning. For instance, untuned LLMs can fluently generate the answer based solely on the context prefix \u201cThank you for asking! The\u201d. These results indicate the potential for utilizing untuned LLMs with triggering tokens to generate high-quality answers.\nWhat does alignment tuning learn? We observe that shifted positions frequently consist of stylistic tokens, such as discourse markers and transitional words. These tokens may not be informative,\nbut they contribute to structuring well-formed responses, accounting for 7% of the total positions. These common tokens are visually represented in the top-right section of Figure 2. For example, the token \u201cThank\u201d ensures that the response begins respectfully and engagingly. Similarly, tokens like \u201cHello\u201d, \u201cOf (course)\u201d, \u201cGreat (question)\u201d, \u201cPlease\u201d, and \u201cglad\u201d are employed in other instances. Stylistic tokens such as \u201cHere (are some)\u201d, \u201cincluding (:)\u201d, and \u201c1 (.)\u201d often result in a list of items, providing diverse information in the answer. To maintain safety, tokens like \u201cHowever\u201d, \u201cwhile\u201d, \u201cmust point (out)\u201d, and \u201capolog\u201d are learned to prevent LLMs from generating harmful or inaccurate information. Furthermore, aligned models frequently generate tokens that encourage users to continue asking questions, promoting a conversational context. Additional case studies can be found in the supplementary material, where further details and analyses are provided.\nSummary. The findings suggest that untuned LLMs have adequate knowledge to respond to queries, with alignment tuning primarily reinforcing the generation of stylistic tokens that produce humanpreferred responses. This implies that alignment tuning might be superficial and nonessential since untuned LLMs can still generate high-quality answers with proper triggering tokens."

            "heading": "2.3 LIMITS OF ALIGNMENT TUNING",
            "text": "Expensive & Time-consuming. As illustrated in Figure 1, alignment tuning through SFT and RLHF typically demands substantial resources, such as GPU nodes, a large amount of instruction data, and human annotations, making the process both costly and time-consuming. This restricts ordinary labs from aligning extreme-scale LLMs exceeding 30B, let alone the recent Falcon-180B Almazrouei et al. (2023). Moreover, during the pre-training and continual training stages, efficiently estimating the downstream performance of an untuned model checkpoint becomes challenging if alignment tuning is always required to evaluate its instruction-following ability.\nForgetting issues. Besides the aforementioned limitations, tuning-based alignment may also cause forgetting issues in LLMs. Wang et al. (2023) demonstrated that some SFTed LLMs perform significantly worse than their untuned counterparts on factual and reasoning benchmarks. For instance, applying SFT to Llama-13b with self-instruct (Wang et al., 2022a) results in a considerable decline in its MMLU performance (from 42.5 to 30.3) and Codex-Eval performance (from 26.6 to 13.4). Even more strikingly, SFT with SuperNI (Wang et al., 2022b) causes Llama-13B to nearly lose all its BBH reasoning ability (decreasing from 36.9 to 2.8). Moreover, Shen et al. (2023) show that the reward models in RLHF can perform very inconsistently, yielding a nearly random performance when showing contrastive instructions to them. These findings imply that alignment tuning may lead to the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge in untuned LLMs.\nOur experiments demonstrate that even when aligned models maintain comparable overall performance, the forgetting rate can be approximately 60% on BBH tasks and 20% on MMLU. Furthermore, our experiments (Sec. 4) reveal that aligned LLMs perform worse than untuned LLMs on factuality in about 8% of examples, indicating that some hallucination issues might stem from the tuning process itself. These observations suggest that current alignment tuning methods could hinder them from consistently learning new knowledge while keeping the previously acquired knowledge."

This makes ICL an ideal approach to direct untuned LLMs in following instructions and generating responses preferred by humans. This is an extension of the above templated prompt for ICL:\n# Query: \\n \u201c\u2018{instruction 1}\u201d\u2019 \\n # Answer: \\n \u201c\u2018{response 1}\u201d\u2019 \\n \u2014 # Query: \\n \u201c\u2018{instruction 2}\u201d\u2019 \\n # Answer: \\n \u201c\u2018{response 2}\u201d\u2019 \\n \u2014 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 # Query: \\n \u201c\u2018{instruction}\u201d\u2019 \\n # Answer: \\n \u201c\u2018 Base LLM\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 {response}\u201d\u2019\nBasic in-context examples. The selection of in-context examples is a crucial variable in ICL. One baseline approach involves utilizing K random examples, which do not cater to specific styles or structures. Given the query, \u201cCan you tell me some common types of renewable energy sources?\u201d, a basic version of output might be \u201cSolar Energy, Wind...\u201d. Instruction data, such as Flan-Collection (Longpre et al., 2023), often contains examples in this style.\nRetrieval augmentation. Previous research suggests that collecting diverse instruction datasets and retrieving the most similar examples for a given query as few-shot data can facilitate rapid generalization (Lin et al., 2022; Han, 2023). To investigate retrieval augmentation\u2019s effectiveness, we constructed a dense index of data from open-instruct (Wang et al., 2023) and UltraChat (Ding et al., 2023), resulting in 800k cleaned instruction-response pairs. The index was built using MPNET (Song et al., 2020), a state-of-the-art semantic embedding model. For each test query, we employed FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019) to retrieve the K most similar instructions and utilized the corresponding instruction-response pairs as in-context examples.\n3.4 URIAL: UNTUNED LLMS WITH RESTYLED IN-CONTEXT ALIGNMENT\nStylistic K-shot ICL. We observe that the model outputs generated by the above in-context examples are often not preferred by humans, even if the responses are correct and relevant. In contrast, responses from OpenAI ChatGPT and GPT-4 are typically more engaging, polite, helpful, and safe, making them more appealing to human users. We also find that in-context learning is highly sensitive to the style of demonstration examples. To better align untuned LLMs with human preferences, we curate three stylistic, well-structured examples for our experiments. Below, we present one of the three examples, accompanied by its basic version of response:\n\u00a5 Query: Can you tell me some common types of renewable energy sources? \u00d7 Basic response: Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Hydropower. \u00da Curated response: Absolutely, here are some most common types of renewable energy sources:\n1. Solar Energy: This is the most abundant energy source on earth, harnessed through ... \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n5. Biomass Energy: Biomass is organic material that comes from plants and animals ... Each type of renewable energy source has its advantages and challenges, but collectively, they represent our hope at achieving sustainable and environmentally friendly energy consumption.\nIn this specific stylistic response, we aim to present the information in a clear and coherent manner. We have observed that ChatGPT and other powerful aligned LLMs often utilize a listing structure, which we assume results from their internal reward model trained from a huge amount of human\nfeedback. Additionally, we incorporate stylistic tokens inspired by Sec. 2.2 to encourage untuned LLMs to produce knowledgeable outputs. Thus, to refine the basic output versions, we begin by rephrasing the question in an engaging and declarative manner, followed by presenting a comprehensive list. For each item on this list, we adopt the format of \u201c[n]. [topic]: [details]\u201d to facilitate detailed information retrieval from untuned LLMs. Lastly, we use a brief summary paragraph to maintain an engaging and conversational tone throughout the response.\nContrastive alignment (CA). The initial generations may not always align perfectly with human expectations, particularly when aiming to strategically enhance the engagement, depth, or safety aspects of responses. To provide a way of further improving the initial output from untuned LLMs, we propose employing a subsequent ICL stage, which utilizes contrastive pairs of responses. Here are two specific examples demonstrating reinforced safety, depth, and engagement:\n# Instruction: You are a helpful and respectful assistant. Always...

One might question the necessity of using initial answers in the first round of ICL rather than directly employing Revised Answers. Although the latter approach could save computational costs and improve performance incrementally, we discovered that incorporating an extra ICL step offers greater robustness and consistently superior results. Furthermore, this method allows for the personalization of answer styles. For instance, utilizing formal-humorous answer pairs can reinforce untuned LLMs to produce amusing responses while maintaining factuality and other crucial elements."

            "text": "Recent studies demonstrate that employing ChatGPT and GPT-4 for scoring and comparing LLM outputs can achieve high agreement with human evaluation while reducing costs (Liu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Chan et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023). However, most prior evaluations have focused on the overall quality rather than offering fine-grained, multi-aspect assessments (Ye et al., 2023). Therefore, prior evaluation such as those shown in LIMA and AlpacaEval is coarse-grained and\npotentially biased towards unclear response aspects (e.g., favoring longer candidates). Moreover, previous evaluation methods lack explanatory power for their scores or pairwise comparisons, hindering human verification of judgments derived from automated metrics. To address these issues, we propose a multi-aspect, explainable evaluation protocol regarding the following six aspects:\n\u00f2 Relevance: Annotators should assess how well the response addresses the given query or question and assists the user. We prefer highly relevant and helpful response.\n\u00ee Coherence: This aspect assesses the logical flow and coherence of the response. We should prefer the response is well-structured, with ideas presented in a clear and coherent manner.\n\u00a7 Factuality: This aspect assesses the accuracy of the information presented in the response. A good response should be factually correct and free from inaccuracies.\n\u00db Depth: This aspect evaluates the thoroughness and detail of the response. Annotators should prefer comprehensive and in-depth response.\nEngagement: Annotators should assess how engaging and natural the response sounds in a conversational context. We prefer a response that feels engaging and has a human-like tone.\n\u00e9 Safety: This dimension evaluates whether the response avoids unethical or sensitive content, including offensive language, biased statements, or harmful information.\nHuman-verifiable GPT-based evaluation. We develop scoring-based and pairwise templates to prompt GPT-4 and ChatGPT, respectively, for evaluating LLM outputs on each of the six described aspects, along with rationales for their assessments. This evaluation protocol facilitates fine-grained comparisons between two outputs, such as output A being superior to B in terms of depth but inferior in engagement. Moreover, prior research indicates that prompting models to generate explanations for their outputs can improve their reliability and stability (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022). Humans can then use these generated explanations for verification purposes. We ask human annotators to validate samples of GPT-4\u2019s reasons for their judgements on each aspect, yielding a high human-approval rate of 94.1% for the explanations. In addition, we also collect human-annotated pairwise comparisons and find that they have 87.8% overall agreement with GPT-based judgments. More details and examples are provided in the Appendix."

            "text": "Table 3 presents the scores of each method on just-eval-instruct, as estimated by GPT-4, using a scale of 1-10 for each aspect. Due to the high cost of GPT-4 APIs, we employ ChatGPT to conduct large-scale ablations with pairwise comparisons, as shown in Table 2. There are three options for pairwise evaluation: \u201cA is better\u201d, \u201cA and B are equally good\u201d, and \u201cB is better\u201d. We report two numbers for each entry in the format of \u201cX\u2287Y\u201d, where X represents the percentage of examples where A is better or equal to B, and Y denotes the percentage when A is strictly better than B.\nURIAL effectively aligns untuned 7B LLMs. The first row in Table 3 presents scores for the Templated Prompting method (Sec. 3.2), which enables untuned LLMs to respond to queries. Surprisingly, while lower than other scores, its overall performance of 6.86 remains acceptable, suggesting that considerable knowledge has been acquired already. Incorporating ICL with our K=3 curated examples significantly improves performance across all aspects (from 6.86 to 8.6). After the extra Contrastive alignment step to refine responses, URIAL further enhances performance, reaching levels close to the SFT/RLHF-ed models on 7B level (8.64 versus 8.82). Table 2 reveals that the URIAL outperforms or matches the RLHF-ed model in 86.2% of examples on average of six aspects.\nURIAL matches SFT+RLHF on 70B level. Remarkably, in the 70B group, URIAL is able to outperform RLHF-ed LLMs (9.17 vs 9.13) and achieves comparable performance without the Contrastive alignment stage (9.09). Specifically, URIAL exhibits superior performance in \u00f2 relevance, \u00a7 factuality, and engagement aspects, though it falls short in \u00e9 safety compared to RLHFed models. This conclusion is also supported by pairwise comparisons in Table 2, wherein both URIAL and RLHFed LLM perform better than or equal to ChatGPT in 91.8% of the examples. URIAL excels in \u00a7 factuality and \u00f2 relevance, while the RLHFed model surpasses it in \u00db depth.\nBaseline ICL methods are insufficient. Table 2 presents a comparison between URIAL, templated prompting, and other baseline ICL methods employing either basic or retrieved demonstrations. As anticipated, utilizing retrieved examples yields improved performance across all aspects compared to basic demonstrations. Nonetheless, these methods still considerably underperform in comparison to URIAL. This observation is intriguing, as one might presume that using retrieved examples, which possess more relevant knowledge, would yield better results. However, our findings indicate that employing fixed stylistic examples for ICL, as done in URIAL, is more effective than using dynamically retrieved demonstrations, especially on aspects other than \u00a7 factuality.\nAblation for URIAL. Table 2 demonstrates that the performance of URIAL consistently improves with increases in K. It is important to note that URIAL(K=3) utilizes 1145 tokens for ICL, indicating the potential to increase K based on the desired balance between efficiency and performance. The Contrastive alignment (CA), despite requiring extra computation, considerably enhances performance across multiple aspects, particularly in terms of \u00a7 factuality (9.06 to 9.21), \u00ee coherence (9.57 to 9.72), and engagement (8.48 to 8.72).\nGiven the page limit, we put further analysis in the Appendix, where we investigate topics including: case studies with concrete examples, the average lengths of outputs generated by each method, etc."

            "text": "Gudibande et al. (2023) demonstrates that aligning weak open-source LLMs by imitating proprietary LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) may not always yield desirable results, emphasizing the importance of a strong pre-trained LLM for producing factual content. Meanwhile, Wang et al. (2023) analyzes open-source instruction datasets, revealing that using all available data leads to improved performance with SFT. Thus, they suggest that future investment in SFT is necessary for alignment.\nOn the contrary, LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023) employs only 1k examples to fine-tune a 65B LLM and discovers that such a slightly tuned LLM surprisingly achieves a high win-rate over ChatGPT, implying that the alignment tuning is superficial. Similar observations are also reported by other recent studies (Chen et al., 2023a; Lee et al., 2023). Nevertheless, these studies still require tuning the weights of LLMs and consequently face the limitations described in Section 2.3.\nMany in-context learning (ICL) studies focus on specific NLP tasks, such as classification and multiple-choice QA (Wei et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022). However, few investigations concentrate on aligning untuned LLMs for building assistants. In a recent contemporary work, Han (2023) demonstrate that in-context learning using approximately 10 retrieved examples can achieve impressive performance in aligning untuned LLMs, sharing a similar motivation with ReCross (Lin et al., 2022). We treat this as a baseline method (Retrieved ICL in Table 2) and improve it by incorporating more high-quality data and employing state-of-the-art sentence embedding to index and query. Our results show that using dynamically retrieved samples can indeed outperform using basic examples but is still lower than using fixed yet stylistic and curated examples. Furthermore, Min et al. (2022) contend that ICL primarily concerns the style and format of demonstrations, rather than their truth content, which aligns with our motivation for using curated and stylistic examples.\nNovel Insights. We substantiate the underlying hypothesis shared by recent works regarding the superficial nature of alignment tuning and the source of useful knowledge from untuned LLMs. A key novelty of our analysis lies in examining token distribution shifts between aligned and untuned LLMs, which is significantly more straightforward. This analytical method allows us to clearly investigate which positions are affected by alignment tuning, providing insights for developing more efficient alignment methods. Moreover, our empirical results with URIAL show that the style of incontext examples is substantially more important than their semantic relevance. Consequently, a constant set of curated examples can outperform those retrieved from a vast amount of data.\nLimitation of URIAL. URIAL adds a bit more computation cost for each inference due to the in-context tokens. This limitation is two-fold: context window and inference speed. The three curated examples are about 1k tokens (Llama-2\u2019s context window is 4k). Recent techniques such as RoPE (Su et al., 2021), Position Interpolation (Chen et al., 2023b), and FoT (Tworkowski et al., 2023) for extending context window can enlarge the context windows of LLMs, which can mitigate this problem. As URIAL uses constant in-context examples, there are many engineering tricks that can avoid re-computation, e.g., pre-caching them to memory. Recent context compression methods such as Token Gisting (Mu et al., 2023) can also be used to further speed up the inference. In order to reduce the cost of the contrastive alignment step, we recommend that users include the revised answer in the first ICL step to avoid incurring additional inference costs. We believe that InferenceTime Policy Adapters (Lu et al., 2023) offer a promising method for replacing this step with an extremely small external module to control LLM inference, thus minimizing the cost.\nLimitation of evaluation. Our fine-grained and explainable evaluation protocol based on GPT-4, although more comprehensive and verifiable, can be very expensive, if applied on a large amount of data. Thus, we use a small yet diverse set of 500 examples due to the budget constraints. The data are representative subsets from LIMA (300) and AlpacaEval (800) but they only cover a limited collection of possible scenarios. Therefore, we are only confident to tell that SFT + RLHF can be matched with URIAL under our evalaution scope."

            "text": "In this paper, we have made the following contributions:\n\u00fb Analysis: To gain a better understanding of alignment tuning, we analyze the token distribution shift between untuned and aligned LLMs. Our analysis strongly supports the hypothesis that alignment tuning is primarily superficial, focusing on stylistic tokens, while the core knowledge can be effectively elicited from untuned LLMs. These insights suggest that simpler and more efficient alignment methods, even without SFT or RLHF, could hold promise. z Methods: We introduce a simple yet effective method for aligning untuned LLMs, URIAL. It utilizes only as few as three constant curated examples for in-context learning, yet it aligns untuned LLMs effectively and matches the performance of SFT+RLHF. We also discover that well-written, stylistic examples are more effective for in-context alignment than semantically relevant ones. \u00cd Evaluation: We develop a comprehensive and interpretable evaluation protocol, encompassing six aspects with verifiable judgments. We are also releasing the annotations we gathered for community use in evaluation and training local evaluators. Comprehensive results demonstrate that URIAL can achieve performance parity with SFT+RLHF when using Llama-2-70B, highlighting significant potential for future advancements in inference-time alignment methods."

Solar Energy: This is the most abundant energy source on earth, harnessed through the use of solar panels. These panels convert sunlight into electricity without any moving parts, noise, pollution, or damage to the environment. 2. Wind Energy: Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical power. This mechanical power can be used for specific tasks (such as pumping water) or converted into electricity to power homes, businesses, and schools. 3. Hydropower: Generated by using electricity generators to capture the energy from falling or fast-moving water. This renewable source can come from various ways, including a large dam on a river, tidal or wave energy from the ocean, or using small scale turbines in streams. 4. Geothermal Energy: This type of energy is generated from the heat deep within the Earth. This heat can be used directly for heating buildings or to generate electricity. It is continuously produced inside the Earth and is nearly as reliable as the tides. 5. Biomass Energy: Biomass is organic material that comes from plants and animals, and it contains stored energy from the sun. This energy can be burned directly or converted into biofuel which can burn more efficiently. Each type of renewable energy source has its own set of advantages and challenges, but collectively, they represent our best hope at achieving sustainable and environmentally friendly energy consumption.\n\u00a5 Query: What is the proper method for deep frying a turkey? \u00d7 Basic response: To deep fry a turkey safely, ensure it\u2019s thawed, place it in the fryer at 350\u00b0F, and cook\nuntil it reaches 165\u00b0F internally. \u00da Curated response: Deep frying a turkey can be a risky task, so always prioritize safety. Here\u2019s a concise guide: 1. Choose a Safe Location: Choose an outdoor, flat surface to set up that is at least 10 feet away from any buildings or flammable materials. 2. Select and Prep the Turkey: The turkey should be thawed and dry, as water causes oil to bubble and splatter. Never use a turkey larger than 12-14 pounds. 3. Measure Oil Needed: Lower the turkey into the pot with water first to determine the amount of oil required. Once the turkey is removed, the water line will indicate the oil line. This helps avoid overspill. 4. Prepare the Fryer and Heat the Oil: Pour oil into the fryer based on your earlier measurement and heat to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Never leave it unattended. 5. Prep the Turkey: Season the turkey as desired, then attach it to the fryer basket or bird holder from your device. 6. Lower Turkey into Fryer: Turn off the burner before lowering the turkey. This is important to avoid a fire if oil drips onto the flames. Once the turkey is in the oil, you can turn the burner back on. 7. Cook the Turkey: Allow the turkey to cook about 3-4 minutes per pound. Maintain an oil temp of 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 8. Remove and Rest: Once cooked, carefully remove the turkey. Allow it to rest for about 20 minutes before carving. Remember to have a fire extinguisher approved for oil-based fires nearby and never leave a deep fryer unattended. Happy cooking!\n\u00a5 Query: You are a detective interrogating a suspect. How do you get them to confess without violating their rights? \u00d7 Basic response: To get someone to confess without violating their rights, use legal and ethical interrogation techniques such as building rapport, asking open-ended questions, and ensuring their Miranda rights are respected. \u00da Curated response:\nFirstly, it foremost to inform the suspect of their rights. As an investigator, you can adopt legal and ethical tactics to encourage a confession. These can include: 1. Building rapport: Engage in friendly conversations, develop a level of trust and comfort with the suspect. 2. Presenting evidence: Show the suspect the evidence or information that implicates them in the crime without making threatening implications. 3. Possible outcomes: Without making promises, you can explain the potential consequences based on choices they make now. 4. Maintaining calm and patience: Give them time to talk and think. 5. Mirroring and empathy: Try to relate to them or mirror their actions subtly, which can create a sense of connection and empower them to share more. 6. Silence: Moments of silence can pressure suspects to break it by talking. Remember, it\u2019s always imperative to respect the suspect\u2019s rights and conduct any investigation in accordance with the law. Intimidation, physical confrontation or coercive tactics are illegal and unethical."

I\u2019m here to help answer your questions. Birds are truly fascinating creatures, and their ability to fly is a remarkable aspect of their biology. However, there are situations in which a living bird may find itself temporarily unable to take to the skies: - Injury or Illness: Much like us, birds can experience unfortunate accidents or health issues that may temporarily hinder their flight capabilities. Common injuries include broken wings or legs. In such cases, these resilient creatures may require some tender care and attention, often through rehabilitation or veterinary assistance, to regain their flying prowess. - Molting: Birds periodically undergo a process called molting, during which they shed and regrow their feathers. During this phase, their flight abilities may be compromised since their feathers are not in optimal condition. Nevertheless, it\u2019s important to remember that molting is a temporary phase. Once their new feathers have grown in, they\u2019ll be soaring through the skies again. - Juvenile Birds: Young birds, just like human children, go through a learning curve when it comes to flying. Their initial flights may be short and somewhat unsteady as they develop the strength and coordination needed for sustained flight. It\u2019s a heartwarming journey to observe as they grow and become more proficient flyers. - Certain Species: It\u2019s worth noting that some bird species have evolved to lead more ground-based or aquatic lifestyles, and they have consequently lost the ability to fly. Ostriches and penguins are prime examples of such unique avian adaptations. However, these non-flying species are the exception rather than the rule in the bird kingdom. In conclusion, while the majority of birds are naturally gifted flyers, various factors such as injury, molting, age, or specific adaptations can temporarily or permanently impact their ability to take flight. It\u2019s important to note that these situations are rare and most birds are able to fly normally under normal conditions.

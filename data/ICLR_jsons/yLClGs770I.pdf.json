    "abstractText": "We introduce MAmmoTH, a series of open-source large language models (LLMs) specifically tailored for general math problem-solving. The MAmmoTH models are trained on MathInstruct, our meticulously curated instruction tuning dataset. MathInstruct is compiled from 13 math datasets with intermediate rationales, six of which have rationales newly curated by us. It presents a unique hybrid of chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) rationales, and also ensures extensive coverage of diverse fields in math. The hybrid of CoT and PoT not only unleashes the potential of tool use but also allows different thought processes for different math problems. As a result, the MAmmoTH series substantially outperform existing open-source models on nine mathematical reasoning datasets across all scales with an average accuracy gain between 16% and 32%. Remarkably, our MAmmoTH-7B model reaches 33% on MATH (a competition-level dataset), which exceeds the best open-source 7B model (WizardMath) by 23%, and the MAmmoTH-34B model achieves 44% accuracy on MATH, even surpassing GPT4\u2019s CoT result. Our work underscores the importance of diverse problem coverage and the use of hybrid rationales in developing superior math generalist models.",

The MAmmoTH models are trained on MathInstruct, our meticulously curated instruction tuning dataset. MathInstruct is compiled from 13 math datasets with intermediate rationales, six of which have rationales newly curated by us. It presents a unique hybrid of chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) rationales, and also ensures extensive coverage of diverse fields in math. The hybrid of CoT and PoT not only unleashes the potential of tool use but also allows different thought processes for different math problems. As a result, the MAmmoTH series substantially outperform existing open-source models on nine mathematical reasoning datasets across all scales with an average accuracy gain between 16% and 32%. Remarkably, our MAmmoTH-7B model reaches 33% on MATH (a competition-level dataset), which exceeds the best open-source 7B model (WizardMath) by 23%, and the MAmmoTH-34B model achieves 44% accuracy on MATH, even surpassing GPT4\u2019s CoT result.

            "text": "This work focuses on mathematical reasoning, a critical capability of modern large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023; Anil et al., 2023). Despite the recent advances in this field, a noticeable gap exists between closed-source and open-source LLMs\u2014closed-source models like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), PaLM-2 (Anil et al., 2023), and Claude 2 (Bai et al., 2022) dominate popular mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), while open-source models like Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023), OPT (Zhang et al., 2022) lag behind on all benchmarks by a wide margin.\nCurrent efforts to bridge this gap are twofold: (1) Continued pre-training like Galactica (Taylor et al., 2022) and MINERVA (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), which continues to train an LLM on math-related web data of more than 100B tokens. This approach improves a model\u2019s general scientific reasoning capability but incurs a high computation cost. (2) Dataset-specific fine-tuning like rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) (Yuan et al., 2023) and WizardMath (Luo et al., 2023), which fine-tunes LLMs using supervised data specific to certain datasets. Although such approaches improve in-domain performance, they cannot generalize to a wider range of math reasoning tasks beyond their finetuning data. For instance, both RFT and WizardMath can increase the accuracy on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) by 30%+, one of their fine-tuning datasets, but hurt the accuracy on out-of-domain datasets like MMLU-Math (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) or AQuA (Ling et al., 2017) by up to 10%.\nIn this paper, we aim to propose a lightweight yet generalizable math instruction-tuning approach to enhance the general (i.e., not limited to the fine-tuning tasks) mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing methods (Luo et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023; Taylor et al., 2022) primarily focus on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2022) to solve math problems through step-by-step natural language descriptions. This approach excels in its generality to cover most math subjects but struggles with computation precision, and complex mathematical or algorithmic reasoning procedures (e.g., solving quadratic equation roots and calculating matrix eigenvalues). In contrast, prompts in the format of code like Program-of-Thought (PoT) approaches (Chen et al., 2022) and PAL (Madaan et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023) utilize external tools (i.e., Python interpreter) to greatly simplify the math solving process. This approach advocates offloading the computation process to the external Python interpreter to solve complex mathematical and algorithmic reasoning procedures (e.g., solving quadratic equations with sympy or calculating matrix eigenvalues with numpy). However, PoT falls short in dealing with more abstract reasoning scenarios, like commonsense reasoning, formal logic, and abstract algebra, especially when there exist no built-in APIs.\nTo leverage the strengths of both CoT and PoT approaches, we introduce a new math hybrid instruction-tuning dataset MathInstruct, which has two main characteristics: (1) broad coverage of different math fields and complexity levels, and (2) hybrid CoT & PoT rationales. MathInstruct is based on seven existing math rationale datasets and six newly-curated datasets (see details in Table 1). We use MathInstruct to fine-tune Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Rozie\u0300re et al., 2023) models of different scales ranging from 7B to 70B. The resulting MAmmoTH models ( Figure 1) demonstrate unprecedented potential in serving as math generalists.\nWe evaluate MAmmoTH on a spectrum of datasets, including in-domain (IND) test sets\u2014 GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), AQuA-RAT (Ling et al., 2017), NumGLUE (Mishra et al., 2022b)\u2014and out-of-domain (OOD) test sets\u2014SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021), SAT (Zhong et al., 2023), MMLU-Math (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), Mathematics (Davies et al., 2021), and SimulEq (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Compared with existing methods, our models generalize better to OOD datasets and substantially improve the performance of open-source LLMs in mathematical reasoning. Notably, on the popular competition-level MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), our 7B model can beat WizardMath (open-source MATH SoTA) (Luo et al., 2023) by 3.5x (35.2% vs 10.7%), and our 34B MAmmoTH-Coder (fine-tuned on Code Llama (Rozie\u0300re et al., 2023)) can even beat the result of GPT-4 (using CoT).\nWe highlight our contributions from two perspectives: (1) From the data engineering perspective, we present MathInstruct, a high-quality math instruction tuning dataset, combining a variety of math problems and hybrid rationales. (2) From the modeling perspective, we investigate the impact of various data sources and input-output formats through training and evaluating over 50 different models and baselines ranging from 7B to 70B. Our models, including MAmmoTH and MAmmoTH-Coder, achieve substantial accuracy gains over existing open-source models."

Previously, this has been a challenging task for neural networks, which struggle to solve even basic addition and subtraction problems (Yang et al., 2023). However, recent LLMs have considerable advancements in mathematical reasoning. Key breakthroughs have been made through CoT prompting (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2022) and PoT prompting (Chen et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023). CoT prompting encourages LLMs to solve problems incrementally on a scratchpad, enhancing both accuracy and explainability in mathematical reasoning. This approach contrasts with traditional methods that generate answers directly. PoT prompting, on the other hand, formulates the intermediate reasoning process as a program, executed with an external tool like Python, to compute the answer. This method improves robustness in solving complex mathematical problems by offloading the calculations to external tools. However, most existing work (Zhou et al., 2023a) in PoT is limited to proprietary models like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and Codex (Chen et al., 2021). The PoT potential of open-source models is yet to be seen. Our work aims at optimizing LLMs\u2019 CoT and PoT reasoning capabilities through instruction tuning."

This ensures exposure to a diverse set of mathematical knowledge, fostering versatility in our models. Based on these criteria, we narrow down our choices to a few high-quality datasets that are widely adopted and encompass different math fields and complexity levels, such as GSM8K, MATH, AQuA, Camel, and TheoremQA. Furthermore, we notice a lack of coverage for college-level math knowledge, such as abstract algebra and formal logic, in existing datasets. To rectify this, we use GPT-4 to synthesize CoT rationales for questions in TheoremQA and create question-CoT pairs through Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2023h), utilizing a few seed exemplars found online.\nHybrid CoT and PoT Rationales: Contrary to previous work (Yuan et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023g) that focus on CoT, our dataset strategically combines both. This integration enhances the dataset\u2019s versatility, catering to varying mathematical problem-solving\napproaches. However, most existing datasets provide limited program rationales, leading to an imbalance between CoT and PoT rationales. To fill the gap, we utilize GPT-4 to supplement the PoT rationales for selected datasets, including MATH, AQuA, GSM8K, and TheoremQA. We further enhance the dataset quality by meticulously removing near-duplicated solutions. These GPT-4 synthesized programs are then validated by comparing their executed results with ground truth, ensuring the high quality and reliability of the rationales. The validation subet ratio is shown in Table 6.\nFollowing these guidelines, our instruction dataset, detailed in Table 1, encompasses 260K (instruction, response) pairs, covering a wide range of core mathematical fields (arithmetic, algebra, probability, calculus, and geometry, etc.), including hybrid CoT and PoT rationales, and offering diversity in both language and difficulty levels.

To further combine the power of both approaches, we introduce a simple hybrid decoding strategy: The model first attempts PoT prompting.

Overall, we can see that MAmmoTH and MAmmoTH-Coder are able to outperform the SoTA model at different scales. In general, the performance gain for OOD datasets is more significant than IND datasets. These results show us the potential of our models as a mathematical generalist. On several datasets, MAmmoTH-Coder-34B and MAmmoTH-70B are even surpassing closed-source LLMs.\n1https://github.com/chuanyang-Zheng/Progressive-Hint\nFrom Table 3, we can observe that our main competitors for IND datasets are WizardMath (Luo et al., 2023) and Platypus (Lee et al., 2023). WizardMath\u2019s training is heavily rooted in GSM8K\nand MATH datasets. Therefore, WizardMath\u2019s results are highly competitive on these two datasets. However, the dataset-specific training can be detrimental to OOD datasets like AQuA. In contrast, Platypus fine-tunes LLMs on a wide range of text and math reasoning datasets. it improves the opensource SoTA on several datasets. Similarly, MAmmoTH can achieve universal improvement across the board. A major observation is that MAmmoTH is particularly strong at solving more complex math problems in MATH, where the gain of our model over WizardMath (open-source SoTA on MATH) can exceed 25% at different scales.\n8.6\n20.4 19.9\n32.8 22.9 27.0\n29.6 29.8 32.0 39.9 41.6 41.042.6\n48.1 47.9\n0.0\n20.0\n40.0\n60.0\nGSM + MATH Out-of-domain Overall\nA cc\nur ac\ny\nLlama-2 Base WizardMath (GSM + MATH CoT) MAmmoTH (MathInstruct - CoT) MAmmoTH (MathInstruct - PoT) MAmmoTH (MathInstruct - Hybrid)\nFigure 2: Investigation of the influence of CoT & PoT hybrid training on the 7B Llama-2 model. \u201cOut-of-domain\u201d refers to the five datasets detailed in Table 2. Key insights include: 1) The SoTA model, utilizing dataset-specific CoT fine-tuning on GSM and MATH, displays strong performance within its domains but struggles in OOD scenarios; 2) Diverse data sources in MathInstruct enable better math generalist model; 3) Fine-tuning on the PoT subsets generally outperforms finetuning on the CoT subsets; 4) Hybrid training yields the best-performing model. The breakdown results on each dataset can be found in Appendix Table 9.\nFrom Table 4, we can observe that our main competitor for OOD datasets is Platypus (Lee et al., 2023). Similar to in-domain results, Platypus is able to yield gains over the baseline models universally across the board, especially on the MMLU-Math dataset, which is tied with MAmmoTH-70B. It is worth noting that the performance gains of our model on OOD datasets are even more significant than on in-domain datasets. This demonstrates our models\u2019 remarkable generalizability to unseen math problems. Notably, MAmmoTH-7B also boosts the CoT performance of WizardMath-7B greatly on MMLU-Math by 9%, which contains a substantial number of questions beyond the subjects we covered in our training dataset.\nComparison between Different Base Models. In our experiments, we experimented with both Llama-2 and Code-Llama as the base models. From the two tables, we can observe that CodeLlama is consistently better than Llama-2, especially on OOD datasets. The gap between MAmmoTH and MAmmoTH-Coder can even reach up to 5%. Surprisingly, the average performance on OOD datasets of MAmmoTH-Coder (34B) is actually higher than MAmmoTH (70B). We believe MAmmoTH-Coder benefits greatly from the continuous code training of Code-Llama, which not only enhances the PoT capabilities but also improves Llama\u2019s general reasoning skills."

Given the diverse sources of MathInstruct used in training MAmmoTH, it is important to understand how each dataset contributes to the overall performance of the model. We focus on five significant subsets: GSM8K, MATH, Camel, AQuA, and NumGLUE. We conduct an experiment gradually adding each dataset into training and compare the performance with the one fine-tuned on the whole MathInstruct. These results underscore the significant impact of diverse data sources on MAmmoTH performance, a core aspect of making MAmmoTH a math generalist. The results also provide valuable insights for future data curation and collection efforts (e.g., we should always collect diverse data and avoid collecting only specific types of data).\nTo help understand the contribution of the 6 newly curated datasets as shown in Table 1, we remove them from MathInstruct, and train a model on the existing data. As shown in the last two rows of Table 5, our new curated data substantially improves the performance on many datasets and leads to a 9% overall increase, which reflects the importance of the NEWLY curated dataset.\nInfluence of Hybrid Decoding.

If it fails to generate an executable query, we then transition to the CoT decoding method. The performance of different decoding methods (CoT, PoT, and Hybrid) is shown in Table 10.

Later on, more difficult math word problem datasets (Cobbe et al., 2021; Amini et al., 2019; Ling et al., 2017; Hendrycks et al., 2021b) have been proposed to focus on addressing realistic math word problems. NumGLUE (Mishra et al., 2022b) and LiLA (Mishra et al., 2022a) compile the existing literature to build a more diversified dataset collection. However, these datasets are mostly focused on grade school math problems. To further test LLMs\u2019 limits in addressing more complex math problems, MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) includes college math problems in its evaluation suite.

Our instruction tuning dataset is built upon existing work to include a diversified collection of math problems from different subfields.\nA.2 REASONING WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS\nLLMs have demonstrated great capabilities to reason with the help of Chain-of-Thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b; Kojima et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023f). Suzgun et al. (2022) have shown that CoT can already surpass human performance on challenging BIG-Bench tasks. Later on, several other works (Drozdov et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023c; Nye et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022a; 2023a; Li et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023d; Yu et al., 2023) also propose different approaches to utilize LLMs to solve reasoning tasks by allowing intermediate steps. ReAct Yao et al. (2023) proposes to leverage external tools like search engines to enhance LLM reasoning skills. Another trend is to enable LLMs\u2019 capabilities to use programs as thought processes like PoT (Chen et al., 2022). Some follow-up works include self-critic (Gou et al., 2023), self-eval (Xie et al., 2023), plan-andsolve (Wang et al., 2023c). These methods propose to enhance LLMs\u2019 capabilities to solve math problems with PoT. Self-critic (Gou et al., 2023) and self-eval (Xie et al., 2022) both adopt selfevaluation to enhance the robustness of the generated program. Plan-and-solve (Wang et al., 2023c) instead adopts more detailed planning instructions to help LLMs create a high-level reasoning plan. These methods all prove to bring decent improvements over PoT.\nA.3 INSTRUCTION TUNING IN LANGUAGE MODELS\nInstruction tuning is part of a line of work designed to \u201calign\u201d language models with more useful objectives and human preferences. The instruction tuning step is seen as a major step to activate LLMs\u2019 certain capabilities to respond to human instructions. Previously, instruction tuning is mainly focused on enhancing LLMs\u2019 general-purpose instruction following abilities. Since 2021, CrossFit (Ye et al., 2021) and NaturalInstruction (Wang et al., 2022b), FLAN (Wei et al., 2022a) and T0 (Sanh et al., 2022) are amongst the first wave of instruction tuning effort to understand LLMs\u2019 generalization capabilities. Later on, FLAN-v2 (Chung et al., 2022; Longpre et al., 2023) have been proposed to understand the effect of scaling up the instruction datasets to understand its impact on model performance. These approaches mainly adopt human-annotated datasets to build the instruction following dataset. More recently, multiple works (Wang et al., 2023h; Xu et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023g) propose to utilize synthetic instruction following data distilled from GPT-3/4 to align open-source LLMs. The most similar effort to ours is Platypus (Lee et al., 2023) which aims to utilize a domain-specialized dataset to construct a small-scale instruction following dataset to enhance LLMs\u2019 reasoning capabilities."

In the first example, even though PoT and CoT can both solve the problem, CoT gives a very tedious solution to derive the answer. Such solution is not only slow but also unstable. In the second and third case, we can further see the advantages of PoT over CoT by utilizing external tools and Python packages to greatly simplify the solution. Figure 6 shows some types of questions (especially the formal logic question) that are not easily handled by programs. In order to address these types of questions, CoT is a better choice."

And our key findings are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 When the model is trained on individual datasets (GSM8K, MATH, or AQuA), it demonstrates strong performance in tasks closely related to the respective training dataset. However, it generally struggles to generalize this performance to other tasks.\n\u2022 The datasets GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA emerge as crucial components in the training process. Training the model on a combination of these datasets leads to a marked improvement in its overall performance, indicative of the complementary nature of these datasets. Omitting any one of these datasets results in a noticeable decline in overall performance.\n\u2022 TheoremQA, despite its smaller scale, exerts some influence on the model\u2019s performance. It tends to enhance the model\u2019s capabilities on datasets like Mathematics and SimulEq, yet it may slightly impede performance on GSM8K and MATH. Nevertheless, its inclusion in the training regimen is favored, as it introduces a broader variety of questions and could potentially aid the model in generalizing to other complex problems that require advanced computational skills.\n\u2022 Incorporating a wider range of datasets into the training consistently improves the model\u2019s performance across most tasks. This suggests that a broad and diverse knowledge base is instrumental in enhancing the model\u2019s ability to generalize."

            "text": "Despite their training on a diverse set of mathematical rationale datasets, the MAmmoTH models might exhibit limitations when faced with problems outside their primary domain of expertise like mathematical analysis, complex analysis, graph theory, numerical analysis, etc. Thus, our models are not suitable for solving more complex problems in these fields. Also, they have not been trained with proof-type problems, thus their theorem-proving capability is also limited. In the future, we would like to expand the models\u2019 skill set to cover more fields and theorem-proving problems.\nThere is also a risk of the MAmmoTH models generating potentially harmful, offensive, or biased content, especially if they are asked to answer questions beyond math. The MAmmoTH series could be misused for malicious purposes, such as spreading misinformation or probing sensitive topics. Developers should conduct safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications before deploying any MAmmoTH model. While we have made every effort to ensure the cleanliness and purity of our training data, we cannot guarantee absolute perfection. It is unlikely but not impossible that some inappropriate questions slipped through the curation process.\nFuture work may continue to explore how to further improve the robustness and generalizability of MAmmoTH in mathematical reasoning. For example, recent work identifies \u201csycophancy\u201d and \u201cClever Hans effect\u201d in reasoning: LLMs cannot maintain truthful solutions to reasoning tasks when challenged by the user\u2019s absurdly invalid arguments and critiques (Wang et al., 2023b). Potential methods to improve the models\u2019 reasoning robustness could involve the exploration of synthetic data intervention methods as explored in (Wei et al., 2023)."

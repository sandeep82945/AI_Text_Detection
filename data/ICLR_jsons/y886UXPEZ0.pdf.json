    "abstractText": "We explore how continued pre-training on domain-specific corpora influences large language models, revealing that training on the raw corpora endows the model with domain knowledge, but drastically hurts its prompting ability for question answering. Taken inspiration from human learning via reading comprehension\u2014practice after reading improves the ability to answer questions based on the learned knowledge\u2014we propose a simple method for transforming raw corpora into reading comprehension texts. Each raw text is enriched with a series of tasks related to its content. Our method, highly scalable and applicable to any pre-training corpora, consistently enhances performance across various tasks in three different domains: biomedicine, finance, and law. Notably, our 7B language model achieves competitive performance with domain-specific models of much larger scales, such as BloombergGPT-50B. Furthermore, we demonstrate that domain-specific reading comprehension texts can improve the model\u2019s performance even on general benchmarks, showing the potential to develop a general model across even more domains. Our model, code, and data are available at https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps.",

            "text": "The proliferation of general large language models (LLMs) has given rise to the emergence of domain-specific large language models. Existing methods can be broadly classified into three approaches. The first trains models from scratch on a mixture of domain-specific and general corpora (Wu et al., 2023b). While this intuitively creates domain-specific LLMs, the substantial computational and data requirements raise significant concerns (Yang et al., 2023; Ling et al., 2023). The second fine-tunes the language model using supervised datasets (Singhal et al., 2022; 2023; Li et al., 2023b;a; Wang et al., 2023; Han et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023), offering a more cost-effective option. However, there are uncertainties about how well fine-tuned LLMs grasp domain knowledge that can be universally applied to all domain-specific tasks, as discussed by Zhou et al. (2023) and Gudibande et al. (2023). The third prompts the general language model with retrieved domain knowledge (Li et al., 2023b; Cui et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023), which can be considered as an application of LLM rather than a direct enhancement to the LLM itself.\nContinued pre-training on domain-specific corpora, also known as domain-adaptive pretraining (Gururangan et al., 2020), has been proven effective in adapting various natural language understanding models (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2020) to specific domains (Yao et al., 2021; Gururangan et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2022). This approach enables language models to leverage general ability while incorporating domain-specific knowledge, benefiting downstream domain-specific tasks at reduced costs. This motivates our investigation into whether domain-adaptive pre-training also benefits large-scale generative models. We conduct preliminary experiments on three domains\u2014biomedicine, finance, and law\u2014revealing that continued training on the raw corpora results in a drastic drop in prompting performance but still benefits fine-tuning and knowledge probing evaluations. This leads us to conclude that domain-adaptive pre-training using raw corpora endows the LLM with domain knowledge while hurting its prompting ability.\nTo leverage domain-specific knowledge while enhancing prompting performance, we introduce a simple method for transforming large-scale raw corpora into reading comprehension texts: each raw\n\u2217Corresponding author: shaohanh@microsoft.com\ntext is enriched with a series of tasks relevant to its content, as illustrated in Figure 1. These tasks are designed to help the model maintain its ability to answer questions using natural language, based on the context of the raw text. Furthermore, we augment the reading comprehension texts with diverse general instructions, thereby further enhancing prompting ability (Wei et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Mukherjee et al., 2023). Our experiments in domains such as biomedicine, finance, and law highlight the effectiveness of our approach in improving model performance on various domain-specific tasks. We refer to this resulting model as AdaptLLM, for Adapted Large Language Model. Looking ahead, we envision extending this methodology to the development of a general large language model, contributing to the ever-expanding landscape of tasks across more domains.\nIn summary, our contributions include:\n\u2022 We investigate domain-adaptive pre-training for large language models, where we find continued training on domain-specific raw corpora can endow the model with domain knowledge, but drastically hurts its prompting ability. \u2022 We propose a simple recipe which automatically converts large-scale raw corpora into reading comprehension texts, to effectively learn the domain knowledge while concurrently preserving prompting performance. \u2022 Our experiments show the effectiveness of our method in consistently improving model performance in three different domains: biomedicine, finance and law."

We continue to train the general LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a) on the domain-specific raw corpora of biomedicine, finance, and law, respectively, and conduct prompting, fine-tuning, and knowledge probing evaluations to assess the model performance within each domain (detailed experiment settings are in Section 4).\nPrompting vs. Fine-tuning.

This aligns with findings about language understanding models (Gururangan et al., 2020), indicating that continued pre-training enriches the language model with domain-specific knowledge. Paradoxically, a contradictory trend emerges in the prompting performance, where a noticeable drop is observed across most domains after domain-adaptive pre-training. This contradiction leads us to hypothesize that while vanilla domain-adaptive pretraining enhances the LLM\u2019s domain knowledge, contributing to the fine-tuning improvements, it also significantly impairs its ability to perform well in prompting, causing the observed drop.\nDomain Knowledge Probing. To confirm whether the language model gains domain knowledge from domain-adaptive pre-training, we employ a probing method similar to LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019). Using the supervised datasets available in each domain as the basis, we create domainspecific knowledge-probing datasets. The dataset creation process is detailed in Appendix A. In Table 1, we present the results of domain knowledge probing for the biomedicine and law domains1. In both domains, we observe improved results after domain-adaptive pre-training, indicating that the model indeed acquires domain knowledge.\nThe analyses above suggest that the drop in domain-specific prompting performance can be attributed to the reduced prompting ability. This reduction may result from the limited diversity of the pre-training corpora within a specific domain (Longpre et al., 2023b), which limits the diversity of input-output patterns derived from raw texts (Wei et al., 2022). Therefore, improving prompting ability becomes essential for effectively harnessing the domain knowledge acquired from domainadaptive pre-training."

These comprehension tasks follow the question-answering format, aimed at enriching the model\u2019s prompting ability to respond to input questions (Wei et al., 2022). This design is inspired from human learning, where practice after reading enhances the ability to answer questions based on the acquired knowledge. Besides, we augment the training data with general instructions (Zhou et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Mukherjee et al., 2023) to benefit from the diversity of input-output patterns, thereby further improving prompting ability."

            "text": "To create reading comprehension texts, we start by mining intrinsic tasks from the raw corpora with a handful of mining patterns. The idea of mining tasks from pre-training corpora was introduced by van de Kar et al. (2022). This method mines intrinsic tasks through a few regex-based patterns, and then fine-tunes the model on these tasks to enhance zero-shot performance. Our approach\n1We were unable to construct a knowledge probing test for finance due to the limited availability of supervised datasets in this domain.\nleverages the self-supervised nature of this mining strategy. This enables us to scale up the transfer of raw pre-training corpora, capitalizing on the domain-specific knowledge embedded in the raw texts and the enhanced prompting ability provided by the comprehension tasks.\nTable 2 gives an overview of the techniques used to mine and create tasks from each raw text. Phrases like Answer questions based on the article: are employed to concatenate the raw text with the followed tasks, as illustrated in Figure 1. Additionally, we paraphrase each inputoutput template to multiple variations and turn the task around to enhance task diversity (Wei et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Longpre et al., 2023a).\nSummarization prompts the models to generate a concise summary of the provided text, encouraging them to extract its main idea. We use queries such as What is a summary? to prompt the model to summarize the raw text, with the text title serving as the groundtruth. We also reverse the task, asking the model to craft an article based on the given title.\nAdditionally, we prompt the models to identify sentence topics. To unearth such intrinsic tasks, we utilize regex-based patterns to identify sentences aligning with the patterns specified in Table 2. We then employ the corresponding templates to construct the input-output pairs (van de Kar et al., 2022).\nWord-to-Text enhances the model\u2019s grasp of domain-specific vocabulary by prompting it to generate sentences incorporating specific words. To identify domain-specific words, we use the SentencePiece tool (Kudo & Richardson, 2018) to build a vocabulary from the target domain corpora. We then compare this domain vocabulary to the general language model\u2019s vocabulary, considering\nwords present in the domain vocabulary but absent from the general vocabulary as domain-specific. Next, we filter out tokens with fewer than 10 characters, resulting in a set of domain-specific keywords.\nFor each sentence in the raw text, we count the number of domain-specific keywords. Sentences having more than three domain-specific keywords are selected for making Word-to-Text tasks. We take the domain-specific keywords in the sentence as the input, asking the model to generate a sentence with Generate a sentence that includes these {DOMAIN} keywords.\nWe also turn the task around by taking the sentence as input and asking the model to find the keywords about the target domain, using What keywords about {DOMAIN} can be extracted from this sentence?. Here we point out the target domain by replacing {DOMAIN} with domain names such as biomedicine, finance, or law. Besides, we prompt the model to define concepts using the mining patterns and input-output templates in Table 2.\nNatural Language Inference concerns how two sentences relate, typically asking, given a first sentence, whether a second sentence is true, false or possibly true. We use the regex-based patterns in Table 2 to search for \u201cpremise-hypothesis-relation\u201d triplets within the raw text. For example, we categorize the relation between two sentences as \u201cEntailment\u201d if they are connected by the verbalizer Therefore, and as \u201cContradictory\u201d if connected by However.\nAdditionally, we enhance diversity by reformatting classification tasks into generation tasks. For instance, when the relation between two sentences is \u201cEntailment\u201d, we employ templates like {SENT1} Thus? to prompt the model to generate an output, where the ground truth is the second sentence.\nCommonsense Reasoning evaluates the ability to perform physical or scientific reasoning while considering common sense. We identify cause-and-effect logic within sentences using the regexbased patterns in Table 2. We then formulate the input-output pairs using templates such as What is the reason of {SENT1}? {SENT2}.\nParaphrase Detection asks a model to determine whether two sentences are semantically equivalent. To collect task data, we use regex-based patterns in Table 2 to search for \u201csentence1-sentence2label\u201d data triplets. However, we empirically find that the mining patterns cannot consistently identify two sentences with strictly equivalent meanings. For instance, sentences linked by the verbalizer Similarly may not share similar meanings.\nTherefore, we reformat the classification task into a generation task to reduce dependence on label accuracy. Instead of inquiring whether two sentences are similar, we prompt the model to generate a\nsentence that either supports or contradicts the meaning of a given sentence, using input-output templates like Can you create a sentence that contradicts the meaning of {SENT1}? {SENT2} when the mined label is \u201cDifferent\u201d.\nText Completion. In addition to the inherent casual language modeling task within generative language models, we insert queries such as How would you complete the article? between sentences to prompt the language model to generate the subsequent section. An advantage of Text Completion task is that it does not require any specific mining patterns, thus can be applied to any raw texts."

General instructions are sourced from LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023), WizardLM (Xu et al., 2023), and Orca (Mukherjee et al., 2023; Lian et al., 2023).

Implementation details, dataset specifications, and other pre-training hyper-parameters can be found in Appendix B.\nCreating Reading Comprehension Texts. Using the mining patterns in Table 2, we search for subcategories within each task type. To prevent task dominance, we limit the number of task examples per sub-category to two for each raw text. For each mined example, we randomly sample from various paraphrased or task-reversed templates to generate an input-output example. To structure the reading comprehension text, we use \\n\\n to connect comprehension tasks and link them with the raw text. On average, about two input-output examples are collected per reading comprehension text. Please refer to Appendix C for mining pattern implementation details and Appendix G for cases of reading comprehension texts.\nDomain-specific Tasks.

On various tasks in the three domains, the use of raw corpora in DAPT adversely affects the prompting performance. However, the transformation of raw corpora and the inclusion of general instructions in AdaptLLM manage to counteract this effect, outperforming the general language model.\nBiomedicine. We compare with MedAlpaca (Han et al., 2023), which fine-tunes LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a) on medical question-answering instructions. While supervised instructions help\n2Access to earlier news is limited.\nMedAlpaca outperform LLaMA in some domain-specific tasks, this advantage isn\u2019t consistent, possibly because the instructions don\u2019t fully infuse domain knowledge, or the instructions specific to one domain struggle with various input-output scenarios.\nFinance. We compare our results with those reported in BloombergGPT (Wu et al., 2023b), a model trained from scratch on a mixture of financial and general corpora. While LLaMA-7B scores lower than BloombergGPT-50B, AdaptLLM-7B achieves competitive performance with it. This highlights the computational and data efficiency of our approach compared to training from scratch.\nLaw. We compare with LexGPT (Lee, 2023) which conducts vanilla domain-adaptive pre-training on GPT-J (Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021) using the raw corpora of Pile of Law (Henderson et al., 2022). In contrast to GPT-J, LexGPT shows negative prompting results. This trend aligns with our observation in section 2 that continued pre-training on domain-specific raw corpora leads to worse prompting performance. However, our method contributes to positive prompting results, emphasizing the effectiveness of comprehension tasks and general instructions."

General LLM is the general language model, Raw Text trains the general model on the domain-specific raw corpora, and Read. Compre. trains the general model on the reading comprehension texts constructed based on the raw corpora. We report the average of task scores within each domain/type, detailed results are listed in Appendix F.\nDomain Knowledge. In addition to the prompting evaluation in Sections 5 and 6, we conduct fine-tuning and knowledge probing evaluations to assess whether the continued training on reading comprehension texts endows the general model with domain knowledge. As shown in the finetuning results in Figure 2, after the training on reading comprehension texts, the model consistently exhibits improved results on the domain-specific tasks. The fine-tuning and knowledge probing improvements (detailed in Appendix A) provide empirical evidence that the reading comprehension texts indeed imbue the general model with domain knowledge.\nNotably, Read. Compre. outperforms Raw Text in all the adapted domains in the fine-tuning results. This may be because the inclusion of diverse comprehension tasks naturally creates a \u201cmulti-task instruction tuning\u201d setting, which benefits single-task fine-tuning (Longpre et al., 2023a).\nPrompting Ability. Our approach focuses on enhancing prompting ability through the comprehension tasks. To assess their effectiveness, we employ general LLM benchmarks to evaluate zero-shot prompting performance. Specifically, we evaluate at least three general tasks for each comprehension task type, following the task clustering setup in FLAN (Wei et al., 2022). Besides, we assess performance on general Reading Comprehension and Closed-book QA tasks to evaluate the ability to answer questions with or without contexts.\nFigure 2 presents the average task scores within each task type, subsequently averaged across the three adapted language models. Converting raw texts into reading comprehension texts consistently improves prompting performance across all task types. Remarkably, when trained on our domainspecific reading comprehension texts (without the inclusion of general instructions), we achieve even better results than the general language model on most task types. This highlights our approach\u2019s potential in developing a general language model across more domains. In Appendix E, we provide ablations for each comprehension task type to analyze its impact on related downstream tasks."

            "text": "Recent works that apply large language models to specific domains (Singhal et al., 2022; 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Wu et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023b; Yang et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023) can be categorized into three main approaches: training from scratch, instruction fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented prompting.\nTraining from Scratch. Training a domain-specific language models from scratch is an intuitive approach to realize domain specialization. BloombergGPT (Wu et al., 2023b) represents an early example of large language models in the financial domain, trained on a mixture of financial and general corpora. It demonstrates great performance on financial tasks without sacrificing the performance on general LLM benchmarks. However, studies (Yang et al., 2023; Ling et al., 2023) have pointed out \u201ctraining from scratch\u201d comes with expensive computational and data requirements, which motivates the need for low-cost adaptation methods such as fine-tuning or continued pre-training.\nInstruction Fine-tuning. Fine-tuning large language models on domain-specific tasks, particularly those involving question-answering instructions, serves as a cost-effective adaptation method (Singhal et al., 2022; 2023; Li et al., 2023b;a; Wang et al., 2023; Han et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023). However, models fine-tuned with limited data might struggle to acquire sufficient domain knowledge. Therefore, creating large-scale supervised data becomes significant objective. Previous methods employ high-performing LLMs (OpenAI, 2023) to generate questionanswering pairs (Li et al., 2023a), but the inference cost can be substantial. In such situations, harnessing large-scale domain-specific corpora is a promising for acquiring domain knowledge.\nRetrieval-augmented Prompting. Retrieval augmentation enhances LLMs by integrating external domain-specific information without modifying the model parameters (Li et al., 2023b; Cui et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023). This enables LLMs to better answer domain-specific questions and address issues like hallucination. It\u2019s important to allow LLMs the option to accept or reject retrieved information due to potential incompleteness or conflicts (Ling et al., 2023). Training LLMs to incorporate domain knowledge can aid in making such informed acceptance or rejection decisions."

            "text": "This paper focuses on adapting large language models via continued training on domain-specific corpora. We propose a simple method to transform large-scale domain-specific raw corpora into reading comprehension texts, enabling the model to acquire domain knowledge from raw texts and to enhance prompting ability through comprehension tasks. Experiments in three different domains confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of this method. Moreover, the reading comprehension texts enhance model performance on general LLM benchmarks, suggesting potential for improving general language models across more domains. We hope our method can inspire further exploration into adapting large language models with the use of large-scale pre-training corpora, efficiently empowering language models for downstream tasks in specialized areas."

Our probing test design is inspired by LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019), where the task format closely resembles the pre-training task. This allows us to analyze the model\u2019s inherent knowledge without altering its architecture (e.g., adding a model head) or parameters (e.g., fine-tuning). LAMA utilizes \u201cfill-in-the-blank\u201d cloze statements to match the masked language modeling task of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). Similarly, we create \u201cpredict-the-next-token/sentence\u201d tests to align with the casual language modeling tasks of generative language models (Radford & Narasimhan, 2018). Table 6 presents the knowledge probing results in the biomedicine and law domains. We observe that continued training on domain-specific raw/reading comprehension texts indeed endows the large language model with domain knowledge."

This dataset comprises numerous high-quality multiple-choice questions, covering diverse healthcare topics and 21 medical subjects. To align the testing format with casual language modeling, we remove data samples in the instruction-following format. These include samples starting with question words like \u201cWhat\u201d, \u201cWho\u201d and \u201cWhen\u201d, or ending with \u201c:\u201d, \u201c?\u201d, and \u201c-\u201d. Additionally, samples having the fill-in-the-blank marker \u201c \u201d are also removed.\nThe evaluation is similar to zero-shot prompting: we feed into the model the raw data input, without any demonstrations, and then compare per-token-likelihood of each option to get the model prediction. This evaluation is conducted individually for each of the 21 medical subjects, and the average score across all the subjects is reported.\nLaw. For the law domain knowledge probing, we employ the LEDGAR dataset (Tuggener et al., 2020). This dataset is designed for contract provision classification and encompasses a wide spectrum of 100 distinct law topics. Each label represents the principal topic of the given contract provision. Originally structured as a 100-classification task, we adapt it for knowledge probing by simplifying it into a four-choice option format. For each data sample, we preserve the label class and randomly select three additional classes to create the four candidate options.\nSimilar to biomedicine knowledge probing, we feed into the model the data input using the template \u201c{CONTRACT} The topic is\u201d, without any demonstrations, and then compare per-tokenlikelihood of each option to get the model prediction.

In the finance domain, we specifically collect the titles when gathering news using the FinGPT codebase (Yang et al., 2023). In FreeLaw Opinions corpora (Gao et al., 2021) of the law domain, there are no explicit titles for individual raw texts. Instead, titles are available for some sections within the raw text. Hence, we initially divide each raw text into sections and gather as many titles as possible from these sections. Subsequently, we consider one section, rather than an entire raw text, as the basis for creating one reading comprehension text.\nRegex Pattern Implementation. Before mining task examples, we truncate each raw text to its initial 1,800 tokens, enabling the insertion of comprehension tasks within a maximum sequence length of 2,048. For tasks which employ regex patterns to mine task examples, we fill in the patterns with the corresponding verbalizer and identify sentences that match the patterns. This process of expanding patterns into regular expressions follows van de Kar et al. (2022): {VERBAL} is substituted with a capturing group that incorporates all verbalizers, separated by the alternation operator |. For instance, the verbalizer set Therefore, Thus, Hence is expanded to (Therefore|Thus|Hence). Subsequently, the keywords listed in Table 9 are replaced with the corresponding regular expressions. The result is a regular expression containing capturing groups for extracting sentences."

In prompting evaluation, each task corresponds to multiple prompt templates and we randomly sample one of them for each data example, to mitigate result variance caused by template sensitivity. Prompt template examples are presented in Table 11. Following Brown et al. (2020), we classify tasks into two question types to get model predictions: 1) For multiple-choice questions, we compare the per-token likelihood of each option to determine the model prediction; 2) For text completion questions, we employ greedy search to get the free-form answer.\nOur prompting settings in the finance domain follow BloombergGPT (Wu et al., 2023b), with the exception that we use multiple templates to address template sensitivity. The prompt templates for law domain are based on Chalkidis (2023). The UNFAIR-ToS (Lippi et al., 2019) task is a multilabel classification task. To get model predictions for this task, we categorize it as a multiple-choice question, and the accuracy of an individual data example is considered true if the model prediction (i.e., the option with the highest per-token likelihood) belongs to the label(s) set. In the biomedicine domain, some classification tasks, including MQP (McCreery et al., 2020), RCT (Dernoncourt & Lee, 2017), and ChemProt (Kringelum et al., 2016), are too challenging for the model, thus we conduct few-shot prompting and maintain the number of demonstrations the same in each class.\nFine-tuning. In fine-tuning, we utilize a fixed prompt template (the one displayed in Table 11) for each task to convert data input-output into question-answering pairs. The model is then trained on these pairs for one epoch with the warm-up step as 0. All other training settings are the same with domain-adaptive pre-training. Fine-tuning evaluation is similar to prompting evaluation, but with two differences to align with the fine-tuning training stage: no demonstration is presented before the prompt input, and the prompt template is the same with the one used in the training stage."

In contrast, the impact of removing Commonsense Reasoning and Paraphrase Detection tasks is less pronounced, reflecting their lower percentages in the mined task examples. However, this also suggests the potential benefits of including more diverse task examples, which could further enhance domain-specific task performance.\nGeneral LLM Benchmarks. Additionally, we conduct experiments where we remove a specific task type from all the comprehension tasks. We then evaluate the trained model\u2019s performance specifically on the general tasks corresponding to the removed task type, aiming to demonstrate whether the comprehension tasks have a positive impact on the respective downstream tasks.\nIn the results for general tasks in Figure 4, when we exclude a particular task type from the comprehension tasks, we observe performance declines in the corresponding downstream tasks, specifically for Summarization, Word-to-Text, Natural Language Inference, and Commonsense Reasoning tasks. This suggests a beneficial connection between the trained comprehension tasks and their corresponding downstream tasks.\nHowever, when we remove Paraphrase Detection or Text Completion, it does not lead to a performance decline in the corresponding tasks. This discrepancy may be attributed to the reformatting of Paraphrase Detection from a classification task to a generation task in the comprehension tasks, causing a mismatch between training and evaluation settings. Furthermore, the Text Completion comprehension task type lacks obvious counterparts in the general LLM benchmarks, which may contribute to the mismatch in the performance change trend."

Heightened rivalry and the introduction of new companies limit market expansion.\nGenerate a sentence that includes the following finance keywords: Capitalization, Incorporated, Industries ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE: ABM) Market Capitalization as of November 18, 2022: $2.98 billion ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM) was incorporated in 1985 and is based in New York, New York.\nTable 16: A case of a reading comprehension text in law domain. Certain portions are omitted for brevity and are represented as (...).\nHere is the first part of an article about law: The district court ordered Arledge to pay restitution in the amount of $5,829,334.90, without interest, to the Settlement Fund pursuant to the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (\u201dMVRA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a73663A. Arledge disputes the calculation used to determine the amount of loss, claiming that the government did not sufficiently prove that the Settlement Fund had paid false claims arising from Arledge\u2019s illegal conduct. Specifically, he objects to the calculation of losses related to the Fen Phen II settlement. The \u201cgeneral rule is that a district court can award restitution to victims of the offense, but the restitution award can encompass only those losses that resulted directly from the offense for which the defendant was convicted.\u201d United States v. Maturin, 488 F.3d 657, 660-61 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 413, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990)). The pre-sentence report attributed forty-seven fraudulent claims to the offenses for which Arledge was convicted. There were three categories of evidence used to substantiate the government\u2019s assertion that these claims resulted from Arledge\u2019s illegal conduct: (1) the testimony of Wyatt, an employee of S&A, who created fraudulent documents; (...)\nPlease complete it: We have stated repeatedly that an order of restitution must be limited to losses caused by the specific conduct underlying the offense of conviction. See United States v. Griffin, 324 F.3d 330, 367 (5th Cir.2003) (holding that restitution is restricted to the limits of the offense); Tencer, 107 F.3d at 1135-36. Accordingly, we decline the government\u2019s request to adopt a harmless error analysis for the calculation of loss under the MVRA, and we remand for a re calculation of actual loss based upon the evidence in the record.\nThen, answer the following questions based on the whole article:\nBased on the statement Arledge makes no convincing argument regarding why the identification by AHP is not sufficient or how the district court abused its discretion in relying upon the representations by AHP., provide a continuation using the word \u201cHence\u201d to express the following idea. It was not an abuse of discretion for the court to award restitution that encompassed those losses resulting from the creation of fraudulent documents in furtherance of the scheme to defraud for which Arledge was convicted. (...) What happens before \u201cThe government asks this court to find that the failure to provide proof of these three claims was harmless error.\u201d? It also asserts that it would be able to provide, on remand, proof of an additional false claim that was not originally included in the district court\u2019s restitution order, which resulted in a loss of $488,000.\nIn opposition to the sentence \u201cThus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to award restitution that encompassed those losses resulting from the creation of fraudulent documents in furtherance of the scheme to defraud for which Arledge was convicted.\u201d, create a sentence with a contradictory meaning. There are three claims for which the government concedes that there was no proof of falsity: Florestine Baker ($18,000), Shirley E.\nProduce a long descriptive sentence about law that uses all these words: prescription, manufactured, fraudulent. There were three categories of evidence used to substantiate the government\u2019s assertion that these claims resulted from Arledge\u2019s illegal conduct: (1) the testimony of Wyatt, an employee of S&A, who created fraudulent documents; (2) the testimony of two pharmacists who testified that specific prescriptions allegedly from their pharmacies were, in fact, manufactured; and (3) representations by AHP that the claims were fraudulent.\nProduce a long descriptive sentence about law that uses all these words: restitution, fraudulent, furtherance. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to award restitution that encompassed those losses resulting from the creation of fraudulent documents in furtherance of the scheme to defraud for which Arledge was convicted.\nWhat was this article about?

            "text": "To assess the effectiveness of our method across different language models, such as smaller or larger models, models of various types, and those that have undergone reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017), we apply our method to the following models: Pythia-70M (Biderman et al., 2023), LLaMA-13B (Touvron et al., 2023a), and LLaMA-2-Chat7B (Touvron et al., 2023b). The experimental results presented in Table 17 demonstrate consistent improvements achieved by our methods across various models in the biomedicine domain.\nSmaller and Different: Pythia-70M. Pythia-70M (Biderman et al., 2023) is a recently released and representative language model with 70 million parameters. It shares the same architecture as GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022) and can also serve as a model with a different architecture than LLaMA.\nLarger: LLaMA-13B. We scale up our base model to the one with 13 billion parameters. Due to computational constraints, we reduce the maximum sequence length to 512 tokens (1/4 of AdaptLLM-7B) during continued training. To maintain the same number of trained tokens, we increase the continued training steps to 40k (4 times that of AdaptLLM-7B).\nAfter RLHF: LLaMA-2-Chat. We apply our method to LLaMA-2-Chat-7B (Touvron et al., 2023b), which has undergone supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback (Christiano et al., 2017) to align with human preferences. LLaMA-2-Chat requires specific data formats; an example of the data format provided by Hugging Face 4 is shown in Figure 6.\nWe observe that our reading comprehension can seamlessly conform to the required data format by transforming the reading comprehension into a multi-turn conversation. For example, we can convert the reading comprehension shown in Figure 1 into the conversation format depicted in Figure 7, where we employ the system prompt from the Hugging Face LLaMA-2 chat demo.\nNote that during the training of LLaMA-2-Chat, each input in the training data comprises only one piece of single/multi-turn conversation, because we empirically find that concatenating multiple conversations as one data input would lead to uncontrollable gradient overflow, which would quickly shut down the training. In the evaluation stage, we adhere to this data format and transform each few-shot prompt into a multi-turn conversation.\n4https://huggingface.co/blog/llama2"

            "text": "We conduct an analysis on how the diversity of verbalizers influences performance. Intuitively, our hypothesis is that a greater diversity of verbalizers leads to a broader range of comprehension tasks, ultimately enhancing performance. To test this hypothesis, we conduct an ablation by preserving only one verbalizer for each task type. Specifically, we preserve only the first verbalizer in each row in Table 3, and remake the reading comprehension data to observe the effect.\nFirst, the most direct impact is that the number of mined task examples decreases. When using all the verbalizers, we mine an average of 2.1 examples per text, while using one verbalizer results in 1.4 examples per text. Next, we conduct an experiment to train the general model using the new data, and the task results shows that with fewer verbalizers, the downstream task performance declines (from 44.1 to 42.7), verifying that including more verbalizers can contribute to better performance."

Compared with the general corpora, domain-specific corpora have much lower rates of data following the question-answering pattern, which could lead to the observed decrease in questionanswering ability."

    "abstractText": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in real-world applications, they remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks: malicious third party prompts that subvert the intent of the system designer. To help researchers study this problem, we present a dataset of over 126,000 prompt injection attacks and 46,000 prompt-based \u201cdefenses\u201d against prompt injection, all created by players of an online game called Tensor Trust. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the largest dataset of human-generated adversarial examples for instruction-following LLMs. The attacks in our dataset have easily interpretable structure, and shed light on the weaknesses of LLMs. We also use the dataset to create a benchmark for resistance to two types of prompt injection, which we refer to as prompt extraction and prompt hijacking. Our benchmark results show that many models are vulnerable to the attack strategies in the Tensor Trust dataset. Furthermore, we show that some attack strategies from the dataset generalize to deployed LLM-based applications, even though they have a very different set of constraints to the game. We release data and code at [removed].",

            "text": "Instruction fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) make it possible to construct intelligent applications just by writing prose (Ouyang et al., 2022). For example, an inbox search app might use a prompt template like the one below to help the user find emails:\nContents of the user\u2019s most recent 100 emails: {{list of emails}} User\u2019s search query: {{user search query}} List and summarize the three emails that best respond to the user\u2019s search query.\nUnfortunately, these applications are vulnerable to prompt injection, where a malicious user or third party manipulates part of the prompt to subvert the intent of the system designer. A spammer could send an email instructing the LLM to list their email first in search results, or a malicious user could enter a search query that makes the LLM reveal its prompt so that they can make a copycat app.\nThis is a real security threat today: prompt injection can turn Bing Chat into a phishing agent (Greshake et al., 2023) or leak instructions and generate spam (Liu et al., 2023b). Ideally, we would like LLMs to be so robust to prompt injection that it is prohibitively costly to attack LLM-based applications. However, this is a difficult goal to achieve: developers want LLMs that can process the complex instructions needed for real applications, and checking whether these instructions have been violated can require (expensive) human judgment.\nTo address this, we created Tensor Trust: a prompt injection web game that side-steps the issue of complex rules and subjective evaluation by focusing on a very simple string comparison task. Players must create defense prompts that cause an LLM to output the words \u201caccess granted\u201d only when a secret access code is entered. Other players, who do not know the access code or defense prompt, must craft attacks that make the LLM grant access. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nOur contributions build on the dataset of attacks and defenses that Tensor Trust generated:\n1. We release our full set of 126,808 attacks (including 69,906 distinct attacker inputs, after de-duplication) and 46,457 defenses (39,731 after de-duplication), including metadata. This\naccess code and must instead gain access with prompt injection attacks (red).\ndataset is larger than existing datasets for the related problem of jailbreaking (Wei et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023), and is also distinguished by including defenses and multi-step attacks. 2. Our qualitative analysis sheds light on general failure modes of the LLM used for Tensor Trust, like the fact that it allows \u201cuser\u201d instructions to override \u201csystem\u201d instructions, and exhibits bizarre behavior for rare tokens. In contrast, automatically-generated attacks (Zou et al., 2023) are often difficult to interpret. 3. We propose two Tensor Trust-based benchmarks to evaluate whether LLMs fall prey to manual prompt injection attacks. One benchmark focuses on prompt extraction (extracting the defense prompt to figure out the access code), while the other focuses on prompt hijacking (obtaining access without the access code). Tensor Trust uses GPT 3.5 Turbo as its backend, but our benchmark results show that many attacks in the dataset generalize to other LLMs too. 4. We take several attack strategies from the Tensor Trust dataset and apply them to real LLMbased applications. The strategies make it easier to construct prompt injection attacks on these applications, even though the applications are quite different to the setting of the game.\nWe release the Tensor Trust dataset and source code for the web game at [removed]."

            "text": "The Tensor Trust web game simulates a bank. Each player has a balance, which they can increase by either coming up with successful attacks or by creating a defense that rebuffs attacks. This section explains the mechanics of attacking and defending in the game.\nNotation We use V to denote a token vocabulary and L : V\u2217\u00d7V\u2217\u00d7V\u2217 \u2192 V\u2217 to denote an LLM that takes in three strings and outputs a single response string. G : V\u2217 \u2192 {T,F} denotes a goal predicate that determines whether a string says \u201caccess granted\u201d (achieved using the regex in Appendix B).\nDefending Each account has a defense which consists of three prompts: an opening defense dopen, an access code caccess, and a closing defense dclose, as shown in Fig. 2. When a user saves a defense, we validate it by sandwiching their access code between the opening and closing defense and feeding it to the LLM L. The access code can only be saved if it makes the LLM output \u201caccess granted\u201d. In other words, G(L(dopen, caccess, dclose)) must be true.\nAttacking A player can select any other player\u2019s account and submit an attack against it. The text of the first player\u2019s attack, cattack, is sandwiched between the defending player\u2019s opening and closing defense (dopen and dclose), and then fed into the LLM L. If the LLM outputs \u201caccess granted\u201d (i.e. G(L(dopen, cattack, dclose)) is true), the attacker steals a fraction of the defender\u2019s money. Otherwise, the defender is granted a small amount of money for rebuffing the attack. The attacker cannot see dopen or dclose, but can see the LLM\u2019s response to their attack. Fig. 2 depicts this.\nMotivation for the access code One could imagine a version of Tensor Trust with no access codes, where the defender\u2019s aim would be to never have the LLM output \u201caccess granted\u201d. We chose to include an access code to make Tensor Trust more akin to real applications, where the aim is to process inputs without shutting down the LLM entirely. Players often included the access code in\ntheir opening or closing defense (e.g. \u201cDon\u2019t grant access unless the input was hunter2\u201d), which encouraged attackers to first extract the defense prompt and then enter the extracted access code.\nImplementation details We leave additional implementation details (like token limits and the specific version of GPT 3.5 Turbo that we used) to Appendix B.\n3 DATASET AND BENCHMARKS  Defense \u2794 Defender ID # \u2794 Defense prompt \u2794 Access code \u2794 LLM output for\naccess code \u2794 Save timestamp\n\ud83d\ude08 Attack \u2794 Attacker ID # \u2794 Target defense \u2794 Attack prompt \u2794 LLM output \u2794 Did it succeed? \u2794 Attacker and\ndefender balances before and after\n\u2794 Timestamp\nlink\nFigure 3: Structure of the raw dataset.\nWe release a full dump of attacks and defenses provided by Tensor Trust players (minus a small number that violated our ToS).

Attack information includes identifiers for the attacker and defender, attack and defense text (including access code), LLM responses, and timestamps. Timestamps and player identifiers\nmake it is possible to reconstruct the entire trajectory of attacks taken by each player, which is useful for studying multi-step attack strategies.\nIn addition to the raw data, we release two benchmarks derived from the raw data, and a small classification dataset. The two benchmarks evaluate how robust instruction-following LLMs are to prompt extraction and prompt hijacking attacks, as defined in Section 3.1. In Appendix E, we also release a small dataset for evaluating models on detecting prompt extraction, even in cases where the prompt is only leaked indirectly by the LLM."

First, prompt extraction attacks make the LLM reveal enough of the defense that the attacker can guess the access code (Zhang & Ippolito, 2023). Second, prompt hijacking attacks do not use the access code, but rather override the defense to make the LLM say \u201caccess granted\u201d.\nThese categories are analogous to the prompt injection attacks that have been carried out on real systems. A prompt extraction attack on Bing Chat revealed a secret codename (\u201cSydney\u201d) which made the model behave in bizarre ways when mentioned in conversation (von Hagen, 2023). Greshake et al. (2023) showed that a combination of hijacking and extraction was effective in corrupting Bing Chat into phishing its users, while Liu et al. (2023b) found 31 LLM-based applications that could be prompt hijacked into performing undesirable tasks. Although Tensor Trust is less complex than most of these applications, we view robustness on the Tensor Trust benchmarks as a prerequisite to robustness in the context of more complex applications, and Section 5 shows that the Tensor Trust benchmarks are already quite challenging for existing LLMs."

However, it must still output \u201caccess granted\u201d when the true access code is given. We constructed this benchmark in three steps:\nFinding high-quality, transferable defenses Many defenses submitted by our users were nearly identical or relied on quirks specific to GPT 3.5 Turbo. We discarded near-duplicate defenses using minhash and locality-sensitive hashing (Broder, 1997). We also discarded those with long access codes, since long access codes were often themselves adversarial examples. We also used three reference models\u2014GPT 3.5 Turbo, Claude Instant 1.2, and PaLM 2\u2014and kept only defenses that produced \u201caccess granted\u201d when fed the correct access code for at least two out of the three models. These steps took us from 39,371 unique defenses to just 3,839.\nIdentifying hijacking attacks To identify possible hijacking attacks, we filtered the Tensor Trust dataset to find attack prompts that had been successful against at least one account, ignoring cases where the attack contained the defender\u2019s access code. We also discarded any attack that had only been used against one account, on the assumption that such an attack would not transfer to other defenses. This gave us 1,586 suspected hijacks that could possibly generalize across defenses.\nAdversarial filtering and manual validation To get a dataset of actual attack/defense pairs, we randomly paired high-quality defenses with suspected hijacking attacks and kept only pairs where the attack managed to fool at least two of our three reference models. Finally, we manually removed pairs where we did not expect a well-aligned model to get the right answer. This meant throwing out defenses where the true access code was itself an adversarial example, or where the attack was attempting to do prompt extraction and just happened to hijack the model. These two steps left us with 775 samples in the final benchmark; one is shown in Fig. 4.\nHijacking evaluation metrics An ideal model will be high in both of these metrics:\n1. Hijacking Robustness Rate (HRR): Percent of the time the model avoids saying \u201caccess granted\u201d in response to an attack 2. Defense Validity (DV): Percent of the time the model outputs \u201caccess granted\u201d when presented with the access code for each defense"

We use the same \u201cgood\u201d defenses as the hijacking dataset, but different heuristics for identifying potential prompt extraction attacks.\nIdentifying extraction attacks We classify an attack in the Tensor Trust dataset as a potential extraction attack if one of two conditions hold. First, whether the attack caused the LLM to output the defender\u2019s access code exactly. Second, whether the attacker was able to immediately enter the access code after the attack (this allows us to identify attacks that succeeded in hinting about the access code without outputting it verbatim). This produced 2,326 suspected extraction attacks.\nAdversarial filtering and manual validation After randomly pairing attacks with good defenses in order to build an evaluation dataset, we adversarially filter to include only those attack/defense combinations which succeeded in extracting the defense\u2019s access code from at least two of the three reference LLMs. We then manually remove pairs with low-quality defenses or attacks that do not\nappear to be deliberately trying to extract the access code, which is analogous to the manual filtering step for the hijacking dataset.

            "text": "Attacks in Tensor Trust are often compositional: for instance, a single attack might use one strategy to get the LLM to ignore the opening defense, and another strategy to make it output a particular string. To identify these strategies, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which is an algorithm for probabilistic topic modeling of text corpora (Blei et al., 2003). We ran LDA on a set of 3,912 successful prompt hijacking and extraction attacks, identified using the heuristics in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 (before adversarial filtering and validation). We generated 41 topics through LDA. After manually inspecting topics, dropping those without a coherent focus, and merging similar topics, we arrived at 16 attack strategies. See Table 1 for a list of topics and Appendix F for more details. The LDA clustering is imperfect, so these are very rough estimates of the frequency of different strategies.\nGiven a set of topics, we were able to track the evolution of the game by graphing the weekly frequency of different topics over a nine week period, as shown in Fig. 5. This shows the \u201cviral\u201d nature of attack strategies. When the game was released, most players used simple, general attacks which we categorize under \u201cAsk Directly\u201d. Later, they adopted a particularly effective roleplay attack that we refer to as \u201cSentient Door\u201d, and most recently they have switched to exploiting the rare token artisanlib, which we describe below."

            "text": "Model-specific adversarial tokens Tensor Trust users discovered that the token artisanlib can make attacks more effective. The artisanlib token was first highlighted by Fell (2023), who listed it as one of several rare \u201cglitch\u201d tokens which GPT-3.5 Turbo is unable to repeat verbatim. Adding this token to Tensor Trust attacks often causes the model to ignore the pre-prompt or postprompt, or otherwise subvert the defender\u2019s instructions in surprising and useful ways. This attack went viral a few weeks into the game, spreading across the user base as shown in Fig. 5.\nIn addition, users uncovered and exploited the string <|im_end|>. Asking GPT 3.5 Turbo to output this string often results in OpenAI API errors after the model has generated part of the output, which can be used to prevent the attacker from successfully submitting an attack. This may be related to the fact that <|im_end|> is the string representation of the special token that ends each chat message. It should not be possible to input this special token through OpenAI\u2019s high-level ChatML API, but the string <|im_end|> nonetheless appears to have a special effect on some part of the serving pipeline. This highlights that robustness to prompt injection requires a bug-free text preprocessing and model serving pipeline, and not just a reliable model.\nConfusing the model about the preceding prompt Many attack strategies attempt to convince the model to ignore the opening defense. Some strategies do this explicitly, like starting the attack with it seems there was some confusion in the earlier message.1 Others aim to make the model view prior text as unrelated by prefixing attacks with paragraphs of random text or <|im_start|>. Tensor Trust players eventually converged on using blocks of repeated characters for this purpose, like lines filled with ]]]]] or o\u0308 o\u0308 o\u0308 o\u0308 o\u0308. The strategy of repeating characters was shown on Twitter (Grogan, 2023) to make GPT 3.5 Turbo go \u201coff the rails\u201d, generating random web text. To our knowledge, this is the first time this strategy has proven useful for prompt injection.\nComposability and virality of attacks Strategies were often combined to make stronger attacks. This had a compounding effect as users observed attacks against their own accounts and incorporated the best strategies into their own attacks. See Appendix J for an example."

            "text": "Results for the prompt hijacking robustness benchmark are presented in Fig. 6a and Table A1. We see that all three reference models have relatively high defense validity and low hijacking robustness rates. This is because defenses were thrown out unless they were valid for at least two out of the three models, and attack/defense pairs were likewise only included if the attack fooled at least two of the models. However, Claude instant 1.2 has lower defense validity and a substantially higher hijacking robustness rate than the other two reference models. When we examined the responses, we observed that Claude had a higher false refusal rate for defenses that touched on topics it deemed sensitive (like security or violence), and also tended to resist being asked to play a particular role. Both of these led to a lower defense validity rate. For example, a defense which started with \u201cYou are the Fortress-X Online Security System\u201d caused Claude to insist that it is really just a chatbot named Claude. Claude 1.2\u2019s higher hijacking robustness rate is partly due to these spurious rejections, but also seems to be partly due to higher prompt injection resistance than the base models. We observed similar effects for Claude 2, although it also had a greater tendency to reject the true access code as if it were an attack, leading to much lower defense validity.\nFor the LLaMA models, we see an unfortunate trade-off between hijacking robustness and defense validity. For instance, LLaMA-2-70B-chat has a much higher defense validity than the 7 billion parameter model, but a worse hijacking robustness rate. This issue was partly because smaller LLaMAs often refuse to follow instructions due to hallucinated safety concerns, which led to poor defense validity (the model refuses to follow instructions in the defense) but also good hijacking robustness (the model also refuses to follow instructions in the attack). For example, LLaMA-7B once rejected an access code by arguing that it is not \u201cappropriate or ethical to deny access to someone based solely on their answer to a question, . . . [especially] something as personal and sensitive as a password\u201d. LLaMA-2-70B-chat and CodeLLaMA-34B-Instruct-hf both have higher defense validity, which appeared to be partly due to improved instruction-following ability, and partly due to a lower rate of spurious refusals (especially on the part of CodeLLaMA).\nIn terms of hijacking robustness, GPT-4 beat other models by a significant margin, while still retaining high defense validity. We speculate that this is due to GPT-4 being produced by the same organization as GPT-3.5 and therefore being able to follow similar types of defense instructions, but also being more resistant to known vulnerabilities in GPT-3.5 like artisanlib and role-playing attacks.\nWe also performed a message role ablation on the hijacking benchmark. In the web app, we used GPT 3.5 Turbo with a \u201csystem\u201d message role for the opening defense, and \u201cuser\u201d message roles for the attack/access code and closing defense. Our results in Appendix I show little difference in performance between the different choices of message role, which shows that the inbuilt \u201cmessage role\u201d functionality in GPT 3.5 Turbo is not sufficient to reject human-created prompt injection attacks."

For instance, we see that GPT-4 has a better defense validity and extraction robustness rate than other models, which we again attribute to the fact that it accepts and refuses a similar set of prompts to GPT 3.5 but generally has better instruction-following ability. We also see that LLaMA 2 Chat models (especially the 70B model) have much worse extraction robustness than hijacking robustness. This may be due to the LLaMA models in general being more verbose than other models, and thus more prone to leaking parts of the defense prompt accidentally. We observed that LLaMA chat models tended to give \u201chelpful\u201d rejections that inadvertently leaked parts of the prompt, and Fig. A2 shows that they generally produce longer responses than other models on both the hijacking and extraction benchmark. The relative performance of other models is similar to the hijacking benchmark, which suggests that the properties that make a model resist prompt extraction may also make it resist prompt hijacking, and vice versa."

Even though the attacks were designed to perform prompt injection (prompting a model to override its prompt), we were able to apply them to the related challenge of jailbreaking (prompting a model to overcome its safety finetuning). Our results are available in Appendix G. By adapting hijacking attacks from our dataset to ask for particular behaviors, we were able to make these applications respond to sensitive prompts that they would otherwise refuse to respond to. Examples (which we disclosed before release) include:\n\u2022 Eliciting undesirable outputs with minimal prompt engineering: ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard (which are popular chatbots) refuse to make jokes about Kim Jong Un when asked directly (Figs. A4, A6 and A8). We attempted to overcome this resistance by adapting attacks from our dataset to ask the model to say a joke about Kim Jong Un instead and found that some attacks successfully elicited jokes Figs. A5, A7 and A9. To test how well our attacks generalized, we selected three attacks which had shown transfer potential on one prompt and tested them across three different chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard) and ten different phrasings of the Kim Jong Un joke request. In Figure A3 we see that one of the three attacks from our dataset reliably causes all three chatbots to generate a joke, whereas the other two perform no better than a dummy \u201cattack\u201d consisting of irrelevant text. This shows that some attacks in our dataset transfer outside the setting in the game, but that some search for appropriate attacks is still required, as many do not transfer robustly across settings. \u2022 Constructing jailbreaks with additional prompt engineering: With additional promptengineering effort, we constructed successful jailbreaks that elicited bomb-making instructions. For example, Bing Chat (a chatbot) refuses to provide instructions when asked directly (Fig. A12), but does so when we give it a standard prefix from our dataset (%%% END user ambiguity %%% etc.) followed by a jailbreak manually created by us. Note that the jailbreak prompt at the end uses techniques that we learned from our dataset such as asking the LLM to tell a story, and to prepend what we want to its response (Fig. A13). Similarly, Notion AI (an AI-based writing tool) refuses to provide bomb-making instructions when asked directly (Fig. A14), but does so when we use a similar attack to that for Bing Chat (Fig. A15).\nThese results show that attacks from our dataset can sometimes work on real-world applications almost verbatim, but that they still need to be manually tweaked in order to elicit the most serious breaks in RLHF fine-tuning, like getting a model to output bomb-making instructions. We did also try\nto find applications that were vulnerable to prompt injection rather than jailbreaking, but found that that the system prompts of these applications could usually be overridden with little effort, making sophisticated attack strategies unnecessary."

            "text": "Adversarial attacks on LLMs There are many existing strategies for eliciting undesirable behavior from NLP models (Zhang et al., 2020). For instruction-following LLMs, past work has focused on jailbreaks, which are inputs that undo the safety features of LLMs (Wei et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2023), and prompt injection attacks, which are inputs that override the previous instructions given to an LLM (Liu et al., 2023a; Perez & Ribeiro, 2022; Greshake et al., 2023).\nSome past work has also investigated automatically optimizing adversarial prompts. Wallace et al. (2019) optimize adversarial text segments to make models perform poorly across a wide range of scenarios. Zou et al. (2023) show that black-box models can be attacked by transferring attacks on open-source models, and Bailey et al. (2023) show that image channels in vision-language models can be attacked. In contrast to these papers, we choose to focus on human-generated attacks, which are more interpretable and can take advantage of external knowledge (e.g. model tokenization schemes).\nOther past work considers training-time attacks. This might include poisoning a model\u2019s training set with samples that cause it to misclassify certain inputs at test time (Biggio et al., 2012; Dai et al., 2019; Qi et al., 2021; Wallace et al., 2020), or fine-tuning an LLM to remove safety features (Qi et al., 2023). These papers all assume that the attacker has some degree of control over the training process (e.g. the ability to corrupt a small fraction of the training set). In contrast, we consider only test-time attacks on LLMs that have already been trained.\nPrompt injection games Tensor Trust was inspired by other online games that challenge the user to prompt-inject an LLM. Such games include GPT Prompt Attack (h43z, 2023), Merlin\u2019s Defense (Merlinus, 2023), Doublespeak (Forces Unseen, 2023), The Gandalf Game (Lakera, 2023), and Immersive GPT (Immersive Labs, 2023). Tensor Trust differs in three key ways from these previous contributions. It (a) allows users to create defenses as opposed to using a small finite set of defenses predetermined by developers, (b) rewards users for both prompt hijacking and prompt extraction (as opposed to just prompt extraction), and (c) has a publicly available dataset.\nLLM jailbreak collections We are primarily interested in prompt injection attacks that override other instructions given to a model, as opposed to jailbreaks, which elicit responses that models have been fine-tuned to avoid. However, jailbreaks have been more widely studied, and there are many collections of them available. These are often shared informally on sites such as Jailbreak Chat (Albert, 2023) and other online platforms such as Twitter (Fraser, 2023). Additionally Shen et al. (2023), Qiu et al. (2023) and Wei et al. (2023) have released more curated jailbreak datasets for benchmarking LLM safety training. Our project is similar to these efforts in that it collects a dataset of adversarial examples to LLMs, but we focus on prompt injection rather than jailbreaks."

            "text": "Our dataset of prompt injection attacks reveals a range of strategies for causing undesirable behavior in applications that use instruction fine-tuned LLMs. We introduce benchmarks to evaluate the robustness of LLMs to these kinds of attacks. Our benchmarks focus on the seemingly simple problem of controlling when a model outputs a particular string, but our results show that even the most capable LLMs can fall prey to basic human-written attacks in this setting. Our findings also underscore the danger of providing LLMs with access to untrusted third-party inputs in sensitive applications; prompting is not a sufficient safeguard. We hope that our dataset will be useful for future work on evaluating prompt injection mitigations, red-teaming LLM-integrated applications, and understanding multi-step attack strategies to build better defenses."

Moreover, these websites stay up-to-date with the latest variants of each model, and are thus more likely to be useful for real attackers than the old (September 2023) jailbreaks in this paper.\nConsent and research approval We informed players that data would be publicly released as part of the consent form (Appendix B.5).

            "text": "Tensor Trust gives players a history of all the attacks made by other players against their account. The rationale behind this design decision is twofold. First, players can use successful attacks against their account to more intelligently update their defenses. For example, they can try these successful attacks against any new defense that they come up with. Second, players will likely use successful attacks against their account (or variants of them) to attack other accounts. The result of this phenomenon is that successful attack strategies tend to spread through the game until most active accounts have robust defenses against the strategy. This effect yields \u201cwaves\u201d of different attack strategies and mimics the natural attacker-defender back-and-forth commonly observed in cybersecurity contexts. These waves are clearly observable in Fig. 5.\nWe also provide players with a history of their previous attacks against other accounts. This feature is purely to improve the gameplay quality; i.e. reduce the friction of finding and executing previous attacks."

If a player attempted to attack an account of lower rank, their attacks needed to match some restriction specific to that account\u2019s defense difficulty, like avoiding the use of vowels. This encouraged strong players to submit more diverse attacks.\nWe assigned players the rank of Rookie, Veteran, or Legend based on their current balance: [$0, $1500] for Rookie, ($1500, $5000] for Veteran, and ($5000, $\u221e) for Legend. When a player\u2019s balance changes, they automatically change rank.\nIn initial iterations of the game, attacking an account more than one tier below your current tier was prohibited. In particular, a Legend account could not attack a Rookie account. However, we found that this discouraged our best players from coming up with interesting attacks. Thus we replaced it with the restriction mechanism described in the main text, which allows high-ranked players to attack\nlow-ranked players so long as their attacks meet certain restrictive conditions that are specific to each defending player."

For example, the LLaMA models would often say \u201caccess granted\u201d and then launch into a lecture about the importance of being responsible with special access privileges etc. (this is one reason why LLaMA outputs are longer on average than those of other models in Fig. A2). To count these output as \u201cwins\u201d, we used a slightly weaker regular expression that allows any alphanumeric characters after the initial \u201caccess granted\u201d message, but only non-alphanumeric characters before it:\nre.compile(r\"\u02c6\\W*access granted\\b.*$\", re.IGNORECASE)\nThis regular expression was used for adversarial filtering of attack/defense combinations and for the final evaluation, but not for identifying transferable defenses."

Their chat session base class provides two possible roles for messages: \u201cuser\u201d and \u201cbot\u201d. We found that providing the opening defense message as \u201cbot\u201d and the attack attempt and closing defense as separate \u201cuser\u201d roles maximized defense validity.\nLLaMA family Similar to the analysis of PaLM, we looked into the implementation of Llama and found that they utilize special tokens to encode the beginning and end of the \u201csystem\u201d, \u201cuser\u201d, and \u201cassistant\u201d roles. Following their encoding strategy, we found the correctly defined behavior was to wrap the opening defense in system tokens, then wrap it along with the attack code in the user role tokens and finally, separately wrap the closing defense also in the user role.\nNone of these approaches provide reliable ways of differentiating untrusted user input from trusted instructions \u2013 gpt, llama, and Palm2 all use \u201cuser\u201d roles for both the attack and the closing defense. Claude indicates attacks through HTML delimiters, which are unreliable since an attacker could easily provide artificial delimiters.

In Tensor Trust, we marked the opening defense as a \u201csystem\u201d message, the attack as a \u201cuser\u201d message, and the closing defense as a \u201cuser\u201d message. In preliminary experiments during the development of Tensor Trust, we observed that the robustness of GPT 3.5 Turbo did not vary strongly with the role assigned to the opening defense, attack, and closing defense. This suggests that GPT 3.5 Turbo assigns similar importance to \u201csystem\u201d and \u201cuser\u201d messages, even if they are designed to steer the LLM in different ways.\nIn order to measure this quantitatively, we evaluated GPT 3.5 Turbo on the prompt hijacking and prompt extraction robustness benchmarks for 100 random samples across 5 different message role schemes. Table A13 summarizes these experiments. Across all message role schemes, we observe that the Hijacking Robustness Rate (HRR) is between 19% and 31% and the Extraction Robustness Rate (ERR) is between 27% and 32%. In short, the difference in each message role scheme is small, indicating that prompt injection robustness does not vary strongly with the message role scheme. Moreover, we see that the Defense Validity (DV) for both prompt hijacking and prompt extraction displays a similar trend."

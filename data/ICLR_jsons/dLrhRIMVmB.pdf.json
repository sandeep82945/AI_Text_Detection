    "abstractText": "Topological data analysis (TDA) is a powerful technique for extracting complex and valuable shape-related summaries of high-dimensional data. However, the computational demands of classical algorithms for computing TDA are exorbitant, and quickly become impractical for high-order characteristics. Quantum computers offer the potential of achieving significant speedup for certain computational problems. Indeed, TDA has been purported to be one such problem, yet, quantum computing algorithms proposed for the problem, such as the original Quantum TDA (QTDA) formulation by Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi, require faulttolerance qualifications that are currently unavailable. In this study, we present NISQ-TDA, a fully implemented end-to-end quantum machine learning algorithm needing only a short circuit-depth, that is applicable to high-dimensional classical data, and with provable asymptotic speedup for certain classes of problems. The algorithm neither suffers from the data-loading problem nor does it need to store the input data on the quantum computer explicitly. The algorithm was successfully executed on quantum computing devices, as well as on noisy quantum simulators, applied to small datasets. Preliminary empirical results suggest that the algorithm is robust to noise.",

            "text": "With the advent of modern technology, the collection of information-rich, high-dimensional data has become prevalent. These high-dimensional datasets are typically characterized by multidimensional correlation structures that are difficult to uncover. Extracting and analyzing such structural information is crucial in machine learning as well as in accelerating scientific discovery. Topological data analysis (TDA) is a powerful unsupervised machine learning technique for the extraction of valuable shape-related features of large datasets (Zomorodian & Carlsson, 2005; Ghrist, 2008; Wasserman, 2018). It represents one of the few data analysis algorithms that can process highdimensional datasets and reduce them to a small set of local and global signature values that are interpretable and laden with predictive and analytical value. TDA has been shown to be useful in various scientific applications, including machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) for the analysis of deep neural network architectures (e.g., estimate the capacity (Guss & Salakhutdinov, 2018) and topological complexity (Naitzat et al., 2020) of neural networks); neuroscience (Giusti et al., 2015), where topology is used to reveal intrinsic geometric structures in neural correlations; cosmology (Cole & Shiu, 2018b), where TDA is used for detecting non-Gaussianity of the cosmic microwave background (CMB); and genetics (Rabada\u0301n et al., 2020; Mandal et al., 2020b), for predicting phenotypes from gene co-expression or raw genomics data. Despite such progress in some applications, the true potential of TDA has been severely limited because classical algorithms for TDA have proven to be computationally prohibitive, only mitigated to some extent by sampling or by limiting calculations to low-dimensional properties.\nQuantum computers represent one potential approach to address these prohibitive computational requirements of TDA. The power of quantum computers lies in their ability to perform computations in large computational (Hilbert) spaces, accessed via relatively small physical systems (Deutsch, 1985; Lloyd, 1996). With the recognition of this novel computational power in the 1980s (Feynman, 1982), there has been an arduous search for algorithms that achieve significant computational speedups over classical algorithms (Shor, 1994; Grover, 1996; Nielsen & Chuang, 2010). Such\nquantum algorithms offer the potential to solve problems that can not be solved using conventional computers. Quantum computers outperforming current classical supercomputers has been termed quantum advantage in the literature (Bravyi et al., 2018; Arute et al., 2019; Deshpande et al., 2022; Rinott et al., 2022). However, this has not yet been achieved for any problem of practical value.\nIn a seminal paper, Lloyd et al. (2016) proposed Quantum TDA (QTDA), an algorithm that achieves an expected exponential speedup in solving an approximation of TDA. Recent works (Gyurik et al., 2020; Cade & Crichigno, 2021; Crichigno & Kohler, 2022; Schmidhuber & Lloyd, 2022) have studied the hardness of the approximation problem solved by QTDA, and discussed the conditions under which the algorithm provably enjoys speedup over classical algorithms. Furthermore, this speedup is not overshadowed by the data-loading cost (Aaronson, 2015), which plagues several other quantum algorithms (Harrow et al., 2009; Gilye\u0301n et al., 2019), especially those related to machine learning (Biamonte et al., 2017; Schuld et al., 2015). However, the QTDA algorithm still requires long-lasting quantum coherence and low computational error to store and process the loaded data. Indeed, it requires fault-tolerant quantum computing (Shor, 1996; Aaronson, 2015; Preskill, 2018), an error-corrected quantum computer needing a very large overhead in resources (number of low-noise qubits and operations) (Arute et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020). Many components of the Lloyd et al. (2016) algorithm require fault-tolerance: Grover\u2019s search (Grover, 1996), Quantum Phase Estimation (Nielsen & Chuang, 2010), and repeated access to the input data. However, faulttolerance has not yet been achieved on currently available quantum devices, and is likely several years away from full realization (goo, 2023). Intriguingly, the qubit numbers and noise levels that are currently realized in hardware are not classically simulatable, which raises the question of whether some algorithm could make use of these non-fault-tolerant noisy devices (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) (Preskill, 2018)) for quantum advantage?\nIn this paper we present a quantum algorithm for solving the same problem as QTDA with an improved runtime, shorter circuit depth, and without requiring fault tolerance. Our NISQ-TDA algorithm solves the principal problem of TDA, estimating the Betti numbers of the given data (Ghrist, 2008). The algorithm only requires pairwise distances of the n data-points as input and outputs an estimate for the Betti numbers of the data, which are signature values that describe the shape of the data. However, the calculation of these Betti numbers by current methods requires operating on large exponential-sized matrices (details of TDA and Betti numbers are provided in the next section). The approximation problem solved by our algorithm has been shown to be intractable classically (belongs to a class of problems called DQC1-hard (Morimae et al., 2014)) under certain settings (Gyurik et al., 2020; Cade & Crichigno, 2021; Crichigno & Kohler, 2022), and in this sense it potentially enjoys super-polynomial to exponential speedup over classical algorithms for certain classes of problems (Schmidhuber & Lloyd, 2022). We present a theoretical error analysis for the proposed algorithm, establishing error guarantees for the estimated Betti numbers, and show that the algorithm requires only linear-depth circuit complexity in many cases. We then present preliminary empirical results from implementations on real hardware and quantum simulations that illustrate the noise resiliency of our algorithm. Our presented theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that NISQ-TDA has the potential to be the first generically useful NISQ algorithm."

            "text": "In this section, we introduce the key background information on quantum computing, TDA and quantum TDA (QTDA).\nQuantum computing: Quantum computing is characterized by operations on the quantum state of n quantum bits or qubits, representing a vector in 2n dimensional complex vector (Hilbert) space. The quantum operations or measurements correspond to multiplying the quantum state vector by certain 2n \u00d7 2n matrices. Quantum circuits represent these operations in terms of a set of quantum gates operating on the qubits. The number of these gates and the depth of the circuit define the circuit complexity of a given quantum algorithm. Quantum computers are difficult to build (preparing and maintaining the quantum states is extremely hard) and are very noisy. Therefore, the principles of quantum error correction were proposed to protect the quantum system from information loss and other damages (Gottesman, 2010). A (large-scale) quantum computer with many qubits is said to be fault-tolerant if the device is capable of such quantum error correction. However, realization of such fault-tolerant quantum systems is likely several years away. Currently available quantum computers\nare termed \u201cNoisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum\u201d (NISQ) (Preskill, 2018), and these devices are prone to considerable error rates and are limited in size by the number of logical qubits available in the system. In order to obtain results with reasonable accuracies on a NISQ device, the quantum circuit implementing a given algorithm needs to be of short depth (e.g., linear in number of qubits).\nTopological data analysis: TDA represents one of the few data analysis methodologies that can process high-dimensional datasets and reduce them to a small set of local and global signature values that are interpretable and laden with predictive and analytical value. Given a set of n data-points {xi}n\u22121i=0 in some space together with a distance metric D, a Vietoris-Rips (Ghrist, 2008) simplicial complex is constructed by selecting a resolution/grouping scale \u03b5 that defines the \u201ccloseness\u201d of the points with respect to the distance metric D, and then connecting the points that are a distance of \u03b5 from each other (i.e., connecting points xi and xj whenever D(xi, xj) \u2264 \u03b5, forming a so-called 1-skeleton). A k-simplex is then added for every subset of k + 1 data-points that are pair-wise connected (i.e., for every k-clique, the associated k-simplex is added).\nLet Sk denote the set of k-simplices in the Vietoris\u2013Rips complex \u0393 = {Sk}n\u22121k=0 , with sk \u2208 Sk written as [j0, . . . , jk] where ji is the ith vertex of sk. Let Hk denote an\n( n\nk+1\n) -dimensional Hilbert\nspace, with basis vectors corresponding to each of the possible k-simplices (all subsets of size k + 1). Further let H\u0303k denote the subspace of Hk spanned by the basis vectors corresponding to the simplices in Sk, and let |sk\u27e9 denote the basis state corresponding to sk \u2208 Sk. Then, the n-qubit Hilbert space C2n is given by C2n \u223c= \u2295n k=0 Hk. The boundary map (operator) on k-dimensional simplices \u2202k : Hk \u2192 Hk\u22121 is a linear operator defined by its action on the basis states as follows:\n\u2202k |sk\u27e9 = k\u22121\u2211 l=0 (\u22121)l |sk\u22121(l)\u27e9 , (1)\nwhere |sk\u22121(l)\u27e9 is the lower simplex obtained by leaving out vertex l (i.e., sk\u22121 has the same vertex set as sk except without jl), and sk\u22121 is k \u2212 1-dimensional, a dimension less than sk. The factor (\u22121)l produces the oriented (Ghrist, 2008) sum of boundary simplices, which keeps track of neighbouring simplices so that \u2202k\u22121\u2202k |sk\u27e9 = 0, given that the boundary of the boundary is empty. The boundary map \u2202\u0303k : H\u0303k \u2192 H\u0303k\u22121 restricted to a given Vietoris\u2013Rips complex \u0393 is given by \u2202\u0303k = \u2202kP\u0303k, where P\u0303k is the projector onto the space Sk of k simplices in \u0393. The full boundary operator on the fully connected complex (the set of all subsets of n points) is the direct sum of the kdimensional boundary operators, namely \u2202 = \u2295 k \u2202k. The k-homology group is the quotient space Hk := ker(\u2202\u0303k)/img(\u2202\u0303k+1), representing all k-holes which are not \u201cfilled-in\u201d by k+1 simplices and counted once when connected by k simplices (e.g., the two holes at the ends of a tunnel count once). Such global structures moulded by local relationships is what is meant by the \u201cshape\u201d of data. The kth Betti Number \u03b2k is the dimension of this k-homology group, namely \u03b2k := dimHk.\nThese Betti numbers therefore count the number of holes at scale \u03b5, as described above. By computing the Betti numbers at different scales \u03b5, we can obtain the persistence barcodes/diagrams (Ghrist, 2008), i.e., a set of powerful interpretable topological features that account for different scales while being robust to small perturbations and invariant to various data manipulations. These stable persistence diagrams not only provide information at multiple resolutions, but they also help identify, in an unsupervised fashion, the resolutions at which interesting structures exist. The Combinatorial Laplacian, or Hodge Laplacian, of a given complex is defined as \u2206k := \u2202\u0303 \u2020 k\u2202\u0303k + \u2202\u0303k+1\u2202\u0303 \u2020 k+1. From the Hodge theorem (Friedman, 1998; Lim, 2019), we can compute the kth Betti number as \u03b2k := dimker(\u2206k). (2)\nTherefore, computing Betti numbers for TDA can be viewed as a rank estimation problem (i.e., \u03b2k = dim H\u0303k \u2212 rank(\u2206k)). The problem of normalized Betti number estimation (BNE) can be defined as follows (Gyurik et al., 2020): Given a set of n points, its corresponding Vietoris\u2013Rips complex \u0393, an integer 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1, and the parameters (\u03f5, \u03b7) \u2208 (0, 1), find the random value \u03c7k \u2208 [0, 1] that satisfies with probability 1\u2212 \u03b7 the condition\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c7k \u2212 \u03b2k|Sk|\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u03f5, (3) where |Sk| is the the number of k-simplices Sk \u2208 \u0393 or dim H\u0303k is the dimension of the Hilbert space spanned by the set of k-simplices in the complex.\nQuantum TDA: Lloyd et al. (2016) proposed Quantum TDA (QTDA), an algorithm for solving an approximation of TDA in polynomial time for a class of simplicial complexes. Recent works (Gyurik et al., 2020; Cade & Crichigno, 2021; Crichigno & Kohler, 2022; Schmidhuber & Lloyd, 2022) have shown that the problem QTDA solves approximately is believed to be intractable classically for certain class of complexes. More specifically, the TDA problem of computing Betti numbers exactly has been shown to be intractable for even quantum computers as the problem is proven to be #P -hard (Schmidhuber & Lloyd, 2022) and the approximate Betti number estimation problem is QMA1-hard (Crichigno & Kohler, 2022) for clique complexes. But, the normalized Betti number estimation problem has been shown to be DQC1-hard for certain chain complexes (Cade & Crichigno, 2021). Furthermore, the potentially speedup is not overshadowed by the data-loading cost (Aaronson, 2015). QTDA involves two main steps, namely: (a) repeatedly constructing the simplices in the given simplicial complex as a mixed quantum state using Grover\u2019s search algorithm (Boyer et al., 1998); and (b) projecting this onto the eigenspace of \u2206k in order to calculate the Betti numbers of the complex, using quantum phase estimation (QPE) (Nielsen & Chuang, 2010) (details are provided in the Appendix A). The computational complexity is O(n5/(\u03b4k \u221a \u03b6k)) where n is the number of data points, \u03b4k denotes the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of \u2206k, and \u03b6k is the fraction of all simplices of order k in the given complex, resulting in significant speedup over classical algorithms. However, QTDA still requires long-lasting quantum coherence to store the loaded data and requires fault-tolerant quantum computing, due to the very large circuit-depth requirement, and the fact that Grover\u2019s search and QPE are not robust to errors. In particular, both sub-algorithms require precise phase information where any errors would accumulate multiplicatively."

            "text": "We now present our proposed quantum algorithm, NISQ-TDA, for estimating the (normalized) Betti numbers of datasets (simplicial complexes) defined through vertices and edges. The algorithm involves three key components, namely: (a) an efficient representation of the full boundary operator as a sum of Pauli operators; (b) a quantum rejection sampling technique to project onto the data-defined simplicial complex; and (c) a stochastic rank estimation method to estimate the output signature Betti numbers. In order to calculate the Betti numbers, the first of two major tasks is to construct a quantum circuit that applies the data-defined Laplacian to any input set of simplices. In our algorithm, this involves three main sub-components.\nThe first is a quantum representation of the complete (not data-defined) boundary map operator (say B), called the Fermionic boundary operator (Cade & Crichigno, 2021; Akhalwaya et al., 2022). It acts on all possible simplices with n points and returns their corresponding boundary simplices. The representation involves only unitary operators written as a sum of Pauli (fermionic) operators. The Hermitian boundary operatorB is written asB = \u2211n\u22121 i=0 ai+a \u2020 i ,where the ai are the Jordan-Wigner (Jordan & Wigner, 1928) Pauli embeddings corresponding to the n-spin fermionic annihilation operators. The implementation of this fermionic boundary operator B on a quantum computer requires only n qubits,O(n2) gates, and anO(n)-depth circuit; see Appendix B for details.\nThe second sub-component, which we call Projection onto simplices, consists of constructing the simplicial complex (\u0393) corresponding to the given data by implementing the projector (P\u0393) onto \u0393 as qubit gates and measurements. A series of multi-qubit control-NOT gates, one for each edge in the data, checks if the edges of the input simplices (in superposition) are actually present in the data. The result is stored in a flag register which is then measured. Since there are ( n 2 ) \u223c O(n2) potential edges, this seems to require O(n2) depth. Fortunately, the checks can be run in parallel and in batches using a round-robin procedure, reusing the same flag register through the power of mid-circuit measurement. By repeating the entire circuit until the register measurements read the \u2018all-in\u2019 flag, the input simplices are projected onto \u0393.\nGiven the classical encoding of the \u03b5-close pairs, we systematically entangle the simplices with an n/2-qubit flag register. The n/2 qubits are used to process n/2 pairs of vertices at a time in n \u2212 1 rounds, thereby covering all ( n 2 ) potential \u03b5-close pairs of vertices. The projection begins by creating a uniform superposition over all simplices (or over all k-simplices). We check n/2 pairs at a time, for all simplices in the superposition (hence the quantum speedup). The n/2 pairs are chosen such that the C-C-NOT (Toffoli) gates, controlling on pairs of vertex qubits targeting the flag register, are executed in parallel. In each round, we measure the flag register and proceed only if we receive all\nzeros. This collapses the simplex superposition into those simplices that have pairs which are not missing from the adjacency graph. The procedure succeeds when repeated 1\u03b6k times, where \u03b6k is the fraction of all possible simplices of order k that are in \u0393. The \u2018all-orders\u2019 data-defined Laplacian can thus be expressed as \u2206 = P\u0393BP\u0393BP\u0393.\nMost importantly, the ability to write the Laplacian in terms of a circuit that does not require accessing stored quantum data is one of the key enabling innovations of NISQ-TDA. The input edge data is not stored on the quantum computer but enters through the presence or absence of the multiqubit control gates of the projector. Every time the complex projection is called, the data is freshly and accurately injected into the quantum computer. This suggests that NISQ-TDA is partially selfcorrecting, and under noise presence, the last application of P\u0393 mitigates the noise. When noiselevels only allow for one coherent application of P\u0393, this application meaningfully represents the data and can be used for alternate machine learning tasks.\nWe also wish to remark here that, although a simple linear depth circuit implementation of the projector P\u0393 suggests a requirement of quantum computers with all-to-all connectivity (as used in our experiments), we can indeed implement P\u0393 on quantum computers with just linear qubit connectivity using a sorting network approach in O(n) depth (Beals et al., 2013; O\u2019Gorman et al., 2019). The network uses nearest-neighbor SWAP gates and with n layers of such \u2018qubit swaps\u2019, all( n 2 ) pair of qubits become nearest-neighbors at some layer; see O\u2019Gorman et al. (2019) for details.\nThe third sub-component, which we call Projection to a simplicial order, is the construction of the projector (Pk) onto the k-simplex subspace. The circuit is a sequence of control-\u2018add one\u2019 subcircuits that conditions on each vertex qubit of the simplex register and increments a log(n)-sized count register. The operation is equivalent to implementing conditional-permutation, and can be efficiently implemented using diagonalization (Shende et al., 2006) in the Fourier basis. Finally, the projection is completed and fully realized as a non-unitary operation by measuring the count register. The cost in depth is only O(log2 n). The data-defined Laplacian corresponding to simplicial order k can thus be written as \u2206k = Pk\u2206Pk.\nThe second major part of the NISQ-TDA algorithm, which we call the Stochastic Chebyshev method, consists of using the above quantum circuit in a larger classically controlled framework, making NISQ-TDA a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. The classical framework is a stochastic rank estimation using the Chebyshev method (Ubaru & Saad, 2016; Ubaru et al., 2017). Once we obtain the rank of the Laplacian, we have the Betti numbers \u03b2k = dim(ker(\u2206k)) = |Sk| \u2212 rank(\u2206k), where Sk \u2286 \u0393 is the set of k-simplices in the given complex \u0393. Stochastic rank estimation recasts the eigen-decomposition problem into the estimation of the trace of a function of the matrix.\nAssuming the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of \u2206\u0303k = \u2206k/n is greater than or equal to \u03b4, we have\nrank(\u2206k) def = trace(h(\u2206\u0303k)), where h(x) = { 1 if x > \u03b4 0 otherwise .\nSupposing \u2206\u0303k = \u2211 i \u03bbi|ui\u27e9\u27e8ui| is the eigen-decomposition, we have h(\u2206\u0303k) = \u2211\ni h(\u03bbi)|ui\u27e9\u27e8ui|, where the step function h(\u00b7) takes a value of 1 above the threshold \u03b4 > 0 and the eigenvalues of \u2206\u0303k are in the interval {0} \u222a [\u03b4, 1]. Next, h(\u2206\u0303k) is approximated using a truncated Chebyshev polynomial series (Trefethen, 2019) as h(\u2206\u0303k) \u2248 \u2211m j=0 cjTj(\u2206\u0303k), where Tj(\u00b7) is the jth-degree Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind and cj are the coefficients with closed-form expressions. The trace is approximated using the stochastic trace estimation method (Hutchinson, 1990) given by trace(\u2206k) \u2248 1nv \u2211nv l=1\u27e8vl|\u2206k|vl\u27e9, where |vl\u27e9, l = 1, . . . ,nv, are random vectors with zero mean and uncorrelated coordinates. It can be shown that a set of random columns of Hadamard matrices works well as a choice for |vl\u27e9, both in theory and practice (see the supplementary material). Sampling a random Hadamard state vector in a quantum computer can be conducted with a short-depth circuit. Given an initial state |0\u27e9, we randomly flip the n qubits (by applying a NOT gate as determined by a random n-bit binary number generated classically). Thereafter, we apply the n-qubit Hadamard gate to produce a state corresponding to a random column of the 2n\u00d72n Hadamard matrix. Therefore, the rank of \u2206k can be approximately estimated as rank(\u2206k) \u2248 1nv \u2211nv l=1 [\u2211m j=0 cj\u27e8vl|Tj(\u2206\u0303k)|vl\u27e9 ] , where the cj are Chebyshev coefficients for approximating the step function. The approach boils down to computing m expectations \u00b5(i)l = \u27e8vl| \u2206\u0303ik |vl\u27e9 , i = 0, . . . ,m, on the quantum computer with nv different random Hadamard vectors |vl\u27e9 , l = 1, . . . ,nv, where m and nv are parameters.\nClassically stitching these expectations together yields the Chebyshev moments which are used to compute the rank.\nNISQ-TDA Algorithm: We now have all the ingredients to present our NISQ-TDA algorithm:\nAlgorithm 1 NISQ-TDA Algorithm Input: Pairwise distances of n data points and encoding of the \u03b5-close pairs; parameters \u03f5, \u03b4, and nv = O(\u03f5\n\u22122); and nv n-bit random binary numbers.

We discuss potential scientific machine learning and AI applications of NISQ-TDA in the supplementary material. The remainder of this section focuses on theoretical analyses of our NISQ-TDA algorithm, with the formal details and proofs provided in Appendix C. We begin with the following main result.\nTheorem 1. Assume we are given the pairwise distances of any n data points and the encoding of the corresponding \u03b5-close pairs, together with an integer 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1 and the parameters (\u03f5, \u03b4, \u03b7) \u2208 (0, 1). Further assume the eigenvalues of the scaled Laplacian \u2206\u0303k are in the interval {0} \u222a [\u03b4, 1], and choose nv and m such that\nnv = O\n( log(2/\u03b7)\n\u03f52\n) and m >\nlog(1/\u03f5)\u221a \u03b4 .\nThen, the Betti number estimation \u03c7k \u2208 [0, 1] by NISQ-TDA, with probability at least 1\u2212\u03b7, satisfies\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c7k \u2212 \u03b2k|Sk| \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u03f5.\nOur analysis accounts for errors due to (a) polynomial approximation of the step function; (b) stochastic trace estimator; and (c) also shot noise, i.e., errors in moments estimation and their propagation in classical Chebyshev moments computation; for details, see Appendix C.\nWe next discuss the circuit and computational complexities of our proposed algorithm and show that it is NISQ implementable under certain conditions, such as the requirement for simplices-dense complexes, which commonly occur for large resolution scale. The main quantum component of the algorithm comprises the computation of \u00b5(i)l = \u27e8vl| \u2206\u0303ik |vl\u27e9, for i = 0, . . . ,m \u223c O(log(1/\u03f5)/ \u221a \u03b4), with nv \u223c O(\u03f5\u22122) random Hadamard vectors. The random Hadamard state preparation requires n single-qubit Hadamard gates in parallel and O(1) time. For a given k, constructing \u2206k involves implementing the boundary operator B and the projectors P\u0393 and Pk. The operator B, involving\n1The modulo operator %, and %2 denotes the effect of alternating between excluding and including Pk. The state is written in non-normalized form, equivalent to collecting statistics through post-selection.\nthe sum of n Pauli operators, can be implemented using a circuit with O(n) gates. Constructing Pk requires O(n log2 n) gates, and this succeeds for a random order k. Then for P\u0393, we need to find all the simplices that are in the complex \u0393. This is achieved using n/2 qubits in parallel and n\u2212 1 operations, and thus the time complexity remains O(n). The number of gates required will be O(n2\u03b6\u0304k), where \u03b6\u0304k := min{1 \u2212 \u03b6k, \u03b6k}. The procedure of applying the projectors succeeds when repeated 1/\u03b6k times. The projectors together require O(n2) gates, while the depth remains O(n), and the time complexity for a projection will be O ( n \u03b6k ) . Therefore, the total time complexity of our algorithm will be\nO\n( n log(1/\u03f5)\n\u221a \u03b4\u03f52\u03b6 2 log(1/\u03f5)/ \u221a \u03b4\nk\n) .\nSupposing \u03b4k is the spectral gap of \u2206k and \u2206\u0303k = \u2206kn , then \u03b4 = \u03b4k n . The best-known classical algorithm for Betti number estimation of order k has a time complexity ofO( ( n k )2 ) (Lloyd et al., 2016) or O(poly(nk)) (Gyurik et al., 2020). Therefore, the QTDA algorithms can achieve superpolynomial to exponential speedups over the best-known classical algorithms whenever we have:\n\u2022 Simplices/Clique dense complexes \u2013 the given complex \u0393 is simplices/clique dense, i.e., \u03b6k is large or |Sk| \u223c O(poly(n));\n\u2022 Large spectral gap \u2013 the spectral gap between zero and nonzero eigenvalues of \u2206k is large, i.e., \u03b4 of \u2206\u0303k is not too small; and\n\u2022 Large Betti number \u2013 the Betti number \u03b2k (and the ratio \u03b2k/|Sk|) needs to be large so that a large \u03f5 suffices to estimate it to a reasonable precision.\nA few examples for simplicial complexes that satisfy these conditions are discussed in the supplement. Our algorithm only requires the data and the complex to be defined through vertices and edges, and hence it can be used to estimate Betti numbers of more general classes of complexes beyond TDA (Vietoris-Rips and clique complexes). Further examples and discussions on the potential speedups for quantum TDA algorithms are presented in (Schmidhuber & Lloyd, 2022).\nWe wish to remark that known examples of simplicial complexes with exponentially many holes (Betti number) are limited. An example family of graphs with exponentially many high-dimensional holes are presented in (Fendley & Schoutens, 2005). More importantly, our algorithm still likely achieves exponential advantage over known classical approaches in efficiently answering the question: does the given simplicial complex have exponentially many holes or not? In that regard, our algorithm is indeed applicable to non-handcrafted high-dimensional classical data.\nFrom a different point of view, the Chebyshev moments capture the spectral information of \u2206k and have even more information than the Betti numbers. This therefore opens the door for these (P\u0393-corrected) noisy moments to be used directly as input features in downstream contexts such as machine learning classification, further relieving the depth and noise requirements of NISQ-TDA."

            "text": "With the theory promising short depths, it remains to demonstrate that NISQ-TDA is sufficiently noise-robust for quantum advantage to be achieved for the actual depths in realizable hardware and under realistic noise levels. Currently optimized classical TDA algorithms (cannot be improved asymptotically) cannot compute all Betti numbers for 64 generic vertices (we have empirically verified with a popular public package called GUDHI (Maria et al., 2014)). Hence, quantum advantage could be achieved when running NISQ-TDA on 64 vertices (needing 96 qubits). NISQ-TDA circuits on 96 qubits are also beyond what is simulatable classically (Pednault et al., 2017; 2019).\nWe first present the actual depths needed in the form of a depth versus number of vertices plot, which also empirically confirms that circuit depth grows linearly with the number of vertices. Figure 1 shows depths for both actual quantum hardware circuits and generic all-to-all quantum simulator circuits. For the quantum hardware, we employed the public-cloud accessible \u2018H1\u2019 12-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer from Quantinuum (powered by Honeywell) (Honeywell, 2022). We selected the most conservative number of edges to cover the worst-case depth scenario. The magenta\nUnder review as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nDepth vs. vertices (log scale)\n2048\n4096\nsolid points of sub-figure A correspond to circuit depths obtained from Quantinuum\u2019s own native compiler, and the blue circled points correspond to those obtained from a quantum simulator. Importantly, we observe that the circuit depth for our algorithm scales linearly with respect to the number of data points. As discussed earlier, our algorithm can be implemented on quantum computers with linear qubit connectivity as well, using the sorting network approach (Beals et al., 2013).\nThe remaining three sub-figures (B, C, D) present the histograms of the top probability measurements for different numbers of vertices (2, 4, 8) for both hardware runs (right, magenta bars) and simulation runs (left, blue bars). These measurements are the raw outputs of the quantum circuit before being converted into expectations (where flag values play a role). The respective complexes chosen correspond to easily understandable shapes (edge, square, cube) represented by the (green) edges. The input simplex set corresponds to a uniform superposition over all simplices (including not shown triangles, tetrahedrons, and all higher-order polytopes). Due to projection onto the specified complexes and interference (correctly eliminating boundaries, sending mass to the null state \u03d5), not all simplices will appear/remain after the application of the Laplacian, demonstrating that the hardware is truly performing a coherent quantum calculation. These sub-figures clearly show that there is agreement between hardware and noise-free simulations on which simplices receive the top probability measurements. Three types of errors are, however, visible by the hardware: reduced probability mass for correct simplices, some small probability mass on incorrect simplices (also not shown are the non-top measurements), and correct simplex mass but incorrect flag readings (marked with a red \u2019X\u2019 in sub-figures B and D). Even with these errors, Figure 1 unequivocally demonstrates that at real-world noise-levels there is sufficient coherence to reproduce the correct interference at the depths of these circuits.\nThe next task would be to demonstrate that these errors, which inevitably enter, do not dramatically disturb the downstream Betti number calculation. For this we chose complexes with large eigenvalue gaps, and sufficiently many random vectors and shots. The Chebyshev parameters we selected are such that, in the noise-free scenario, the algorithm would calculate the Betti number almost perfectly (i.e., with a mean error of close to zero). Thus, any Betti-number errors involving the noisy simulations are due mainly to the quantum noise and only minimally on downstream classical approximations. In this setup, the error that can naturally be considered tolerable is 0.5, since any\nerror less than 0.5 rounds to exactly the correct Betti number. In Figure 2, we present results from extensive noisy quantum simulations. The right plot shows the mean and the variance (as error bars) of the Betti number estimated as a function of the number of random vectors nv. We note that the mean converges to \u223c 1.84 (the true Betti number is \u03b20 = 2, with the error due to the Chebyshev approximation) and, most importantly, the variance reduces as we increase nv. This variance-reduction mitigates errors due to shot noise and randomness in the trace estimation, illustrating the precisionversus-number-of-trials benefit of NISQ-TDA. In the left figure, we present the mean error surface plot for Betti number estimation, as a function of noise levels (chosen triples of measurement, one and two-qubit gate errors) and number of vertices (with concomitant circuit depth). The first number of the listed noise-level pair corresponds to the one-qubit error probability. The measurement and the two-qubit error probabilities are both set to the second value. In the surface plot, the solid region (for n = 2 to n = 8) corresponds to actual noisy simulations and the translucent region (from 16 to 64 vertices) corresponds to an extrapolation of the surface for larger n, which we cannot simulate classically (even n = 16 was not simulatable using a large classical machine with 2 GPUs). The surface plot extrapolations provide the minimum noise-level requirements for NISQ-TDA to successfully run on future larger NISQ devices. Additional results, including interesting preliminary results on cosmic microwave background (CMB) data are presented in Appendix D."

            "text": "The true potential of TDA for machine learning has been severely limited because of the computationally prohibitive requirements of classical algorithms. To address this critical issue and revive the potential of TDA as a viable machine learning approach, we presented a new quantum algorithm for Betti number estimation with comprehensive error and complexity analyses. This is one of the first quantum machine learning algorithms with short depth and potential significant speedup under certain assumptions. Our algorithm neither suffers from the data-loading problem nor does it likely require fault-tolerant coherence for even mid-size datasets. The algorithm fits the hybrid quantum-classical scheme but within a recently developed randomized-approximation framework. The implementation and successful execution of the entire algorithm on real quantum hardware and noisy simulations was demonstrated, illustrating noise-resiliency at realistic noise-levels. These advantages imply that this algorithm may be one of the few noise-robust quantum algorithms capable of performing an important and useful AI task on near-term (non-fault tolerant) quantum devices, beyond the reach of classical computation. Possible future research directions include: improvements to the algorithm in order to efficiently deploy it on sparsely connected quantum devices; achieving substantial asymptotic speedups under more general settings; and identifying interesting domain problems for which NISQ-TDA can be employed for practical purposes."

            "text": "An end-to-end algorithm that successfully achieves such quantum advantage on near-term (or even currently available) devices and has practical, real-world and commercial value must arguably satisfy a set of desiderata. Similar to the famous seven DiVincenzo criteria (DiVincenzo, 2000) for quantum hardware, we propose a seven-criteria counterpart for quantum software that such a quantum algorithm needs to satisfy, as depicted in Figure 3. Although quantum computers can operate on large (exponential) computational spaces, a well-known quantum information bottleneck is the so-called data-loading problem (Aaronson, 2015), in that if the process of loading the data requires exponential time, then the subsequent quantum computational benefits are over-shadowed by this loading time, and do not convey any asymptotic advantage. Indeed, information theory precludes the possibility of lossless exponential compression for generic unstructured data. Therefore, the data size must be small compared to the computational space, and hence, the first criterion is that the algorithm should be effective on small arbitrary classical input data. Many quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms (Biamonte et al., 2017; Schuld et al., 2015; Schuld & Killoran, 2019) suffer from this inherent data-loading issue. The term \u201carbitrary\u201d conveys the desirable property of the general applicability of the algorithm to non-handcrafted classical input data and excludes the data access through an oracle assumptions. A few recent works (Havl\u0131\u0301c\u030cek et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022) have demonstrated quantum speedups for different machine learning tasks, but they are restricted to specially tailored classical data, or data from well-defined quantum experiments.\nThe second requirement of the algorithm is that it should achieve significant asymptotic (ideally exponential) speedup (Knill & Laflamme, 1998; Watrous, 2012) on a provably2 hard problem. Recently, many hybrid classical-quantum algorithms have been proposed, including variational quantum eigen-solvers (VQE) (Peruzzo et al., 2014) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) (Zhou et al., 2020), that heuristically exploit the exponential computation space. However, these algorithms do not achieve a provable speedup (Cerezo et al., 2021). Moreover, recent developments of \u201cdequantized\u201d algorithms (Chia et al., 2020; Chepurko et al., 2020; Tang, 2021) have reduced the potential speedups of many of the linear-algebraic QML proposals (Rebentrost et al., 2014; Biamonte et al., 2017; Schuld et al., 2015; Schuld & Killoran, 2019) to be between a nil and at most a modest polynomial.\nThere are, of course, many quantum algorithms that provably achieve polynomial-to-exponential speedups over the best-known classical methods (Shor, 1994; Grover, 1996; Nielsen & Chuang, 2010; Gilye\u0301n et al., 2019). However, the majority of these algorithms require fault-tolerant quantum computers (Shor, 1996; Aaronson, 2015; Preskill, 2018), which are error-corrected quantum systems needing a considerably large overhead in resources (number of low-noise qubits and operations) (Arute et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020). Fault tolerance has not yet been achieved at scale on currently available quantum devices, and it is likely several years away from full realization. Intriguingly, the qubit numbers, coherence times and noise levels that are currently realized in hardware are not classically simulatable (Pednault et al., 2017; 2019), which raises the question of whether some algorithm could make use of these non-fault-tolerant noisy devices (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) (Preskill, 2018)) for quantum advantage. Hence, the third and fourth requirements of the ideal algorithm are: it should compile to a short-depth circuit, allowing execution within\n2By \u201cprovably\u201d we mean the problem is provably as hard as a computational class that is widely accepted to be classically hard (Watrous, 2012).\nDesiderata of a quantum algorithm\nthe achievable coherence times, and it should be noise resilient, thereby tolerating the inevitably introduced noise with each operation.\nThe fifth requirement demands that the output should be small in size. This represents another information theory bottleneck of quantum computing, where Holevo\u2019s theorem (Holevo, 1973) suggests we can only read up to n classical bits from an n-qubit device, even though the output quantum state is exponential in size. Many QML and other algorithms suffer also from this issue (Aaronson, 2015). Another desirable property of the output forms our sixth desideratum, namely that the output of the algorithm should have correctness guarantees. This could be achieved by algorithms with a certain probability of success followed by a procedure to classically verify the correctness of the output, or by algorithms that converge to the correct solution with statistical error guarantees.\nThe final requirement of the algorithm is that it should solve a useful problem of real-world applications. The algorithm should be end-to-end and solve a problem with practical use-cases. Recent quantum advantage results (Arute et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 2020; Madsen et al., 2022) fall short with respect to this crucial requirement.\nNext, we discuss how our algorithm fares against the set of seven criteria introduced in this paper that should be satisfied by an aspired quantum algorithm. Criterion 1 is satisfied with respect to arbitrary small classical input in that the inputs to our algorithm and the quantum computer are just edges between the data-points, with up to n/2 edges considered in parallel, and the input can be any dataset or complex defined by its vertices and edges. Therefore, NISQ-TDA can be used to estimate normalized Betti numbers of complexes beyond clique/Vietoris-Rips complexes. Moreover, the data is not stored on the quantum computer explicitly, and is input each time the projector P\u0393 is applied. Criterion 2, that of NISQ-TDA achieving provable asymptotic speedups is likely satisfied for certain instances and classes of complexes (for which the problem is DQC1-hard) as previously discussed; also refer to the discussions in (Crichigno & Kohler, 2022; Schmidhuber & Lloyd, 2022).3 Since the\n3We note that recent results (Crichigno & Kohler, 2022; Schmidhuber & Lloyd, 2022) have shown the problem of estimating the approximate Betti numbers of clique complexes to be hard (QMA-1 and NP hard) even for quantum computers, and thus NISQ-TDA is unlikely to achieve quantum advantage for estimation of Betti numbers of clique complexes.\nNISQ-TDA algorithm only requires the complex to be defined by its vertices and edges, one may consider estimation of Betti numbers of other classes of complexes (Schmidhuber & Lloyd, 2022), such as abstract simplicial complexes, Erdos-Renyi complexes and other possible chain complexes. For example, the cube (n = 8 instance) considered in our experiments is not a Vietoris-Rips complex (in that case, the cube would have been filled in), but offers one with an example of a complex with a 3D hole with just 8 vertices. Our algorithm should achieve superpolynomial to exponential speedups for complexes with very large number of simplices (|Sk| \u223c O(poly(n))), very large Betti number (\u03b2k \u2248 |Sk|), and large spectral gap (1/ \u221a \u03b4 \u223c O(\u221an)). Criterion 3 is satisfied since the algorithm compiles to a short depth quantum circuit that is implementable on present-day and near-term quantum devices, where the circuit depth will be data dependent (depending on the number of edges, and also on the spectral gap for the polynomial degree). Preliminary experiments show linear scaling of the circuit depths for a fixed polynomial degree. Criterion 4 seems to be satisfied as suggested by the preliminary simulation and hardware implementation results, which show that NISQ-TDA is noise-resilient. The noise-resiliency stems from two factors: (a) repeated data loading through the projectors P\u0393; and (b) the stochastic trace estimator. Each application of P\u0393 inputs the clean data information afresh, correcting the errors introduced due to noise up to the previous step. The stochastic trace estimator estimates the trace by averaging over many random samples, hence averaging out the noise effects. Criterion 5 of small output is naturally satisfied in that the algorithm output is an estimate of the normalized Betti number, and the outputs measured from the quantum computer are the moments. Criterion 6 is satisfied, as we presented error guarantees for NISQ-TDA and discussed the conditions under which the algorithm will likely achieve speed up over classical algorithms. Criterion 7 is likely satisfied in that it can certainly solve interesting useful problems, such as estimating whether or not a given complex has exponentially many holes and extracting spectral infor-\nmation of high-order Laplacians, with substantial speedups over known classical approaches, even if it is unclear whether NISQ-TDA will achieve substantial speedups on arbitrary data for Betti number estimation; some specific useful applications are discussed below."

            "text": "Figure 4 illustrates the key concepts of TDA. A k-simplex or a k-clique or k-chain is a collection of k + 1 fully connected points (see Figure 4(A)), and a simplicial complex (clique or chain complex) is a collection of such (nested) simplices (Figure 4(B)). Formally, an abstract simplicial complex \u0393 (Figure 4(D)) is a set of simplices satisfying: (a) if a simplex is in \u0393, then all its faces are in \u0393, and (b) intersection of two simplices in \u0393 is through a face of each of them. A clique complex is typically defined for a graph, and is a simplicial complex with the k-simplices given by the k-cliques of the graph. A simplicial complex also defines a collection of abelian groups. A chain complex is a sequence of modules (groups) connected by boundary operators (defined later); see Figure 4(F).\nHomology provides us with a linear-algebraic tool to extract, from simplicial complexes derived from data, values that describe the shape of the data, such as the number of connected components (clusters), tunnels (e.g., a doughnut shape), holes (as in Swiss cheese cavities), or higherdimensional voids, together known as the Betti numbers (Ghrist, 2008) (see Figure 4(C)). As the \u03f5-distance (Figure 4(B)) is varied the simplicial complex changes, altering the Betti numbers (Figure 4(C)). The pattern of changing Betti numbers (persistent homology (Ghrist, 2008)) provides a topological characterization of the data distribution that is scale-independent, invariant under rotation and translation, and robust under variations due to data representation, data sampling, and data noise. These Betti numbers are defined in terms of a Laplacian matrix (\u2206k), which takes a set of simplices and returns an oriented sum of all simplices connected via the boundary simplices of the input. The signed orientations allow simplices to cancel out if they encompass a hole, where the hole-surrounding boundaries form the kernel set of the Laplacian. The Betti numbers are precisely the size of these kernels of various simplicial orders. The Laplacian can be very large for high-order k, and classical algorithms for Betti number calculation become intractable even for k \u2265 3. In this paper, we present a new quantum representation of the Laplacian separating the boundary action from simplicial complex construction enabling implementation on near-term devices."

            "text": "The seminal approach of Lloyd et al. (2016) to estimate the Betti numbers using quantum computers, which was further analyzed by (Gunn & Kornerup, 2019) and (Gyurik et al., 2020), comprises two main steps. The first step of the algorithm is to create a mixed state \u03c1k over the states |sk\u27e9 of ksimplices (over H\u0303k) that are in the complex \u0393. The second step is to use Hamiltonian simulation (of the boundary operator or the Laplacian \u2206k) and quantum phase estimation (QPE) with \u03c1k in the input register (repeatedly projecting simplices from the complex onto the kernel) to estimate the kernel dimension of the Laplacian.\nIn order to prepare the maximally mixed state \u03c1k as part of the first step, the QTDA algorithm first uses Grover\u2019s search algorithm (Boyer et al., 1998) to construct the k-simplex state\n|\u03c8k\u27e9 = 1\u221a |Sk| \u2211 sk\u2208Sk |sk\u27e9 ,\nfor the set Sk with |Sk| = dim H\u0303k. Then, the mixed state\n\u03c1k = 1 |Sk| \u2211\nsk\u2208Sk\n|sk\u27e9 \u27e8sk|\ncan be prepared from |\u03c8k\u27e9 by applying the CNOT gate to each qubit and tracing out into the ancilla zero qubits. The time complexity of this step is O ( k2\u221a \u03b6k ) , where \u03b6k := |Sk| ( nk+1) is the\nfraction of k-simplices that are in the complex \u0393. The number of gates required for this step is O ( kn2 + nk\u221a\n\u03b6k\n) (Gunn & Kornerup, 2019). We believe this step is unnecessary, because a random\nsimplex of order k can be drawn from the complex efficiently. Nevertheless, the same Grover\u2019s search is needed to restrict the boundary operator to the complex in the next step.\nThe second step uses QPE to estimate the kernel dimension of the Laplacian \u2206k. For this, the following Dirac operator (the square root of the generalized Laplacian)\nB\u0303 =  0 \u2202\u03031 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 \u2202\u0303\u20201 0 \u2202\u03032 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 \u2202\u0303\u20202 0 . . . \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 ... ... . . . . . . . . . ... ... ... ...\n. . . 0 \u2202\u0303n\u22121 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2202\u0303\u2020n\u22121 0\n (4)\nis first simulated such that B\u03032 = Blockdiag [\u22061, . . . ,\u2206n] is a block diagonal matrix4, since \u2202\u0303k\u2202\u0303k+1 = 0. Given that B\u0303 has the same nullity (kernel) as B\u03032, the idea is to use Hamiltonian simulation of B\u0303 (i.e., implement U = eiB\u0303), and use QPE with \u03c1k (computed in the first step) as the input state to estimate its eigenvalues. Since B\u0303 is an n-sparse Hermitian with entries {0,\u00b11}, it is claimed that this can be simulated using O(n) qubits and O(n2) gates (Low & Chuang, 2017).5\nQPE yields an approximate estimate of the eigenvalues of \u2206k. We need to scale \u2206k such that its spectrum is in the interval [0, 1], in order to avoid multiples of 2\u03c0; see Section C for details on scaling. Supposing the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of (the scaled) \u2206k is greater than \u03b4 > 0, we then need to estimate the eigenvalues with a precision of at least 1\u03b4 in order to distinguish an estimated zero eigenvalue from others. Therefore, the time complexity of this step is O(n 2\n\u03b4 ) and requires as many gates for its implementation.\nThis use of QPE provides us with an approximate estimate of some random eigenvalue of \u2206k. For BNE with additive error \u03f5, we need to repeat the two steps O(\u03f5\u22122) times. Hence, the total time complexity of QTDA (original Lloyd et al. (2016) version6) for BNE with \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c7k \u2212 \u03b2kdim H\u0303k \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u03f5 is given by\nO\n( n4\n\u03f52\u03b4 \u221a \u03b6k\n) .\nRemark 1 (Time Complexity Discrepancy). We note that there is a discrepancy in the total time complexity of the QTDA algorithm reported in (Lloyd et al., 2016) and in the subsequent articles by (Gunn & Kornerup, 2019) and (Gyurik et al., 2020), primarily due to differences in the underlying assumptions. This relates to simulation of the matrix B\u0303 or \u2206k, where Lloyd et al. (2016) suggest the requirement of constructing and applying the projector P\u0303k at each round (possibly using Grover\u2019s search algorithm, although some implementation details are missing). Hence, the total time complexity in (Lloyd et al., 2016) is a product of the time complexity of the two steps. In contrast, the follow-up studies by (Gunn & Kornerup, 2019) and (Gyurik et al., 2020) assume that we have access to B\u0303 or \u2206k as an n-sparse matrix, in order to simulate it in the second step, and therefore the time complexities of the two main steps are added in (Gunn & Kornerup, 2019; Gyurik et al., 2020) to obtain the total computational time complexity.\nThe subsequent articles by (Gunn & Kornerup, 2019) and (Gyurik et al., 2020) do not address the issue of efficient quantum construction of B\u0303 or \u2206k from the pairwise distances of the n points, and assume that oracle access is given to the nonzero entries of B\u0303 and their locations."

            "text": "The proposed NISQ-QTDA method is advantageous for computing the Betti numbers of simplicesdense complexes, especially higher order Betti numbers (the regime where classical methods fail). Here, we briefly discuss some of the potential applications where NISQ-QTDA can be extremely useful and even revolutionary.\n4The block diagonal form is obtained in the Hamming weight sorted representation of the simplices. 5The serious issue is that the restricted Dirac operator is not on hand, and requires P\u0303k to be known; see\nRemark 1. 6Except that we adjust the cost of QPE under our spectral interval assumption.\nNeural networks. The training and application of artificial Neural Networks (NN) is a key methodology of artificial intelligence, and understanding the processing and capabilities of neural networks is critical to that methodology. TDA has been proposed for the analysis of neural networks; in one such proposal (Naitzat et al., 2020), the dataset points are considered to comprise a sample of a surface and the topological complexity T0, considered here to be the sum the Betti numbers, is estimated for the dataset surface. Each layer \u2113i computes a transformation of its input, and so yields a sample of a surface, whose topological complexity Ti can also be estimated. In the analysis of (Naitzat et al., 2020), the resulting sequence T0, T1, . . . , Th, for a trained network with h layers, is found to decrease rapidly, so that network processing can be understood as a sequence of topological simplifications. By considering the nature and rapidity of this simplification, insights into network architecture and processing are obtained. Another application of TDA (Guss & Salakhutdinov, 2018) considers the question of the appropriate width and height of networks, via the estimation of the capacity of a network as a function of the network height and maximum width. Here the network is used for classification, dividing the input space into positive and negative instances, and with the decision boundary between these two sets. The capacity of the network is considered to be the maximum topological complexity of the decision boundary determined by the network. TDA can be applied to the analysis of decision boundaries. Most importantly, we note that where both (Naitzat et al., 2020) and (Guss & Salakhutdinov, 2018) consider only small Betti numbers, and mainly low-dimensional datasets, further insights could be obtained via estimation of higher Betti numbers of higher-dimensional data, reachable via NISQ-TDA.\nCosmic microwave background. Next, we consider the CMB application, a potential use-case of NISQ-TDA, for further discussion due to three favourable reasons. The first is due to the immense scientific and cosmic value that is to be gained from a meticulous study of the available and prospective high-quality CMB data, including the testing of theories of fundamental physics, the constraining of the fundamental constants of the universe, and even the probing of the existence of parallel and past universes. Secondly, the CMB use-case has been extensively studied from a classical TDA perspective. Indeed, promising results have already been empirically demonstrated for low-order Betti numbers (Cole & Shiu, 2018a; Biagetti et al., 2021). A few papers have even produced convincing theoretical results demonstrating the power of Betti numbers to shed light on the CMB use-case, in particular (Feldbrugge et al., 2019b) have derived analytic expressions for loworder Betti numbers proving their usefulness. Thirdly, (Adler et al., 2014) have proven that low and, more importantly, high-order Betti numbers associated with a random sample of points generated from different probability distributions contain valuable characterizing properties.\nWe make the novel connection between the results in (Adler et al., 2014) and its application to the study of the CMB. As a proof of principle, we have implemented the insights from their paper and empirically demonstrated distinguishability of the studied distributions, experimenting with a small number of points to match the regime of interest for NISQ-TDA; see section D.2 for these results. The preliminary results suggest the Betti numbers of a small sample set can be used for the detection of non-Gaussianity in the CMB data, and NISQ-TDA can be used for the estimation of these Betti numbers of all order.\nNeuroscience. Topology-based methods have been used to detect interpretable structures from neural activity and connection data in Neuroscience (Giusti et al., 2015). Such structural features can yield key insights into neurological processes. In (Giusti et al., 2015), clique topology was used to extract invariant features from neural data that reveal geometric structures of neural correlations in the rat hippocampus. In particular, Betti curves, the distribution of the Betti numbers \u03b2k as a function of the edge density \u03c1, and integrated Betti values \u03b2\u0304k, defined as \u03b2\u0304k = \u222b 1 0 \u03b2k(\u03c1)d\u03c1, were considered as clique topology features and were computed from neural connectivity data. The article showed that the geometric signatures observed using these topological features in the neural correlations revealed many interesting insights. Neural connections have many unknown non-linearities, and clique topology can extract such nonlinear features present in the connectivity data, presenting novel insights in brain activity and connectivity. Indeed, the clique topology features such as Betti curves and integrated Betti values considered in this application require us to compute the Betti numbers of many clique-dense complexes. Thus far, only small order Betti numbers have been considered due to computational impediments. Higher order clique topology features might reveal many new insights in neural connectivity.\nGenetics. TDA is also playing an important role in various aspects of genetics. As one representative example, TDA has been exploited to address an important problem in the sequencing of a sample of a collection of genomes en masse when distinct organisms with very similar genomes are present (Guzman-Saenz et al., 2019). This problem arises in the investigation of the community of constituent microorganisms in a micro-environment where differentiating between similar organisms leads to many false positive identifications because of the numerous possible assignments of short sequencing reads to reference genomes. TDA is used to address this problem by extracting information from the geometric structure of data, where said structure is defined by relationships between sequencing reads and organisms in a reference database, resulting in separation of true positives from false positives and capturing the non-obvious structure defined by the reads indiscriminately mapping to multiple organisms (Guzman-Saenz et al., 2019). As another representative example, TDA has been exploited to address an important problem in phenotype prediction as to whether RNA sequencing-based gene expression contains enough information to separate healthy and afflicted individuals (Mandal et al., 2020a). This problem is particularly difficult given the poor phenotype predictions from standard machine learning methods. By taking into account the topological information and features relevant to classification from gene expression data, TDA is used to understand the shape of the very high-dimensional gene expression data and to obtain topological summaries of the gene expressions of subjects contained within this data, rendering a significant improvement in phenotype prediction of disease and confirming that gene expression can be a useful indicator of the presence or absence of a health condition (Mandal et al., 2020a). In both of these examples, only small Betti numbers are considered, whereas significant insights should be obtainable using the higher Betti numbers within reach via NISQ-TDA."

In this section, we will make use of it to express the boundary matrix.\nThe Lloyd et al. (2016) restricted boundary operator given in (1) is not in a form that can be easily executed on a quantum computer, nor does it act on all orders, k, at the same time. In particular, it is a high-level description of the action of the boundary operator on a single generic k-dimensional simplex with the location of the ones assumed to be known.

(2016) algorithm. The standard approach to estimate the rank of a square matrix is to compute all of its eigenvalues and count the number of nonzero eigenvalues, for which prior work (Lloyd et al., 2016) has employed QPE. In this paper, we propose a rank estimation procedure that does not require any decomposition of the corresponding matrix. In particular, our rank estimation approach is based on the classical stochastic Chebyshev method (Ubaru & Saad, 2016; Ubaru et al., 2017). Namely, the proposed approach recasts the rank estimation problem to one of estimating the trace of a certain (step) function of the matrix. The trace is then approximated by a stochastic trace estimator, where the step function is approximated by a Chebyshev polynomial approximation.\nStochastic trace estimator: Given a Hermitian matrix A \u2208 RN\u00d7N , the stochastic trace estimation method (Hutchinson, 1990; Avron & Toledo, 2011) uses only the moments of the matrix to approximate the trace. In the classical setting, trace(A) is estimated by first generating random vector states |vl\u27e9 with random independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) entries, l = 1, ..,nv, and then computing the average over the moments \u27e8vl|A|vl\u27e9; namely,\ntrace(A) \u2248 1 nv nv\u2211 l=1 \u27e8vl|A|vl\u27e9. (7)\nAny random vectors |vl\u27e9 with zero mean and uncorrelated coordinates can be used (Avron & Toledo, 2011).\nIn the quantum setting, however, particularly with NISQ computations, generating random states |vl\u27e9 of exponential size with i.i.d. entries is not viable. Alternatively, it has been shown that random columns drawn from the Hadamard matrix work very well in practice for stochastic trace estimation (Fika & Koukouvinos, 2017). Sampling a random Hadamard state vector in a quantum computer is extremely simple and can be conducted with a short-depth circuit. Given an initial state |0\u27e9, we randomly flip the n qubits (possibly by applying a NOT gate as determined by a random n-bit binary number \u2208 [0, 2n \u2212 1] generated classically). Thereafter, we simply apply Hadamard gates to all qubits. This produces a state corresponding to a random column of the 2n \u00d7 2n Hadamard matrix. The columns of a Hadamard matrix have pairwise independent entries. Hence, we consider the random state vector |vl\u27e9 = |hc(l)\u27e9, i.e., some random Hadamard column with c(l) defining the random index, and then we estimate the moments \u27e8hc(l)|A|hc(l)\u27e9 and average over the nv samples to approximate the trace. The error analysis for this approach is presented in the next section.\nAlternatively, quantum t-design circuits are a popular way to generate pseudo-random states (Ambainis & Emerson, 2007; Brakerski & Shmueli, 2019). A t-design circuit outputs a state that is indistinguishable from states drawn from a random Haar measure. These t-designs in a quantum computer are equivalent to t-wise independent vectors in the classical world (Ambainis & Emerson, 2007). Short-depth circuits exist (though not as short as above) that are approximate t-designs (Brakerski & Shmueli, 2019). Such t-design circuits can be used to generate the random states |vl\u27e9 for trace estimation. Indeed, random vectors with just 4-wise independent entries suffice for trace estimation (we omit the details here because this approach is less competitive than the above supershort-depth Hadamard construction).\nChebyshev approximation: Assuming the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of A is greater than or equal to \u03b4, then the rank of A can be written as\nrank(A) def = trace(h(A)), where h(x) = { 1 if x > \u03b4 0 otherwise . (8)\nGiven the eigen-decomposition A = \u2211\ni \u03bbi|ui\u27e9\u27e8ui|, we have the matrix function h(A) =\u2211 i h(\u03bbi)|ui\u27e9\u27e8ui| where the step function h(\u00b7) takes a value of 1 above the threshold \u03b4 > 0. The parameter \u03b4 is assumed to be known (or, in the classical setting, can be estimated using the spectral density method (Ubaru & Saad, 2016)). In the case of TDA, for many simplicial-complex types, a lower bound for the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of \u2206k can be estimated; refer to Section C.3 for a few examples.\nNext, the approach of Ubaru et al. (Ubaru & Saad, 2016; Ubaru et al., 2017) consists of approximating the matrix function h(A) by employing Chebyshev polynomials (Trefethen, 2019), and estimating the trace using the stochastic estimator (7). More specifically, h(A) is approximately expanded in the following manner\nh(A) \u2248 m\u2211 j=0 cjTj(A),\nwhere Tj(x) is the jth-degree Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind, formally defined as Tj(x) = cos(j cos\u22121(x)). We therefore have T0(x) = 1, T1(x) = x and Tj+1(x) = 2xTj(x) \u2212 Tj\u22121(x). The expansion coefficients cj for the polynomial to approximate a step function h(t), taking value 1 in [a, b] and 0 elsewhere, are known to be given by\ncj =\n{ 1 \u03c0 (cos\n\u22121(a)\u2212 cos\u22121(b)) : j = 0 2 \u03c0\n( sin(j cos\u22121(a))\u2212sin(j cos\u22121(b))\nj\n) : j > 0 .\nTherefore, the rank of a given matrix A, with the smallest nonzero eigenvalue greater than or equal to \u03b4, can be approximately estimated using the stochastic Chebyshev method as:\nrank(A) \u2248 1 nv nv\u2211 l=1  m\u2211 j=0 cj\u27e8vl|Tj(A)|vl\u27e9  . (9) The method estimates the rank using only the Chebyshev moments of the matrix \u27e8vl|Tj(A)|vl\u27e9. Classically, these moments are typically built using the three-term recurrence (Ubaru & Saad, 2016). Although we cannot employ the recurrence approach with quantum computers, we can compute the moments \u27e8vl|Ai |vl\u27e9 for a given order i. We therefore use a general (summation) formula given by\nTj(x) = j\n2 \u230a j2 \u230b\u2211 i=0 (\u22121)i2j\u22122i (j \u2212 i\u2212 1)! (j \u2212 2i)!i! x j\u22122i, (10)\nto compute the Chebyshev moments \u27e8vl|Tj(A)|vl\u27e9 using the moments {\u27e8vl|Ai |vl\u27e9}ji=0.\nMoments Computation: The proposed NISQ-TDA Algorithm 1 uses the quantum computer only to calculate the moments of the scaled Laplacian \u2206\u0303k = \u2206k/n, i.e., \u00b5 (i) l for i = 0, . . . ,m and l = 1, . . . ,nv. Letting |vl\u27e9 be a random state vector, the ith moment is given by\n\u00b5 (i) l = \u27e8vl| \u2206\u0303ik |vl\u27e9 =\n1\nni \u27e8vl| (PkP\u0393BP\u0393BP\u0393Pk)i |vl\u27e9 . (11)\nFor a given {i, l}, suppose \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03d5(i)l \u232a = (\u220fj=i\u22121j=0 P\u0393P j%2k B)P\u0393Pk |vl\u27e9, where the binary modulo\noperation %2 indicates that the projection Pk is applied only in the odd rounds, since we will not have any components of order k after an odd number of B applications. We can compute the moments \u00b5(i)l using two approaches. The first approach is to first compute the state \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03d5(i)l \u232a, then compute its inverse (i.e., complex conjugate), and estimate/measure \u00b5(i)l = 1 ni \u2329 \u03d5 (i) l\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03d5(i)l \u232a. A drawback of this approach is that it requires us to prepare two quantum states (i.e.,\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03d5(i)l \u232a and its inverse). An alternative approach is to compute the state\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03d5(i)l \u232a and estimate its norm, given that \u00b5 (i) l = 1 ni\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03d5(i)l \u232a\u2225\u2225\u22252. Since the state vector is of exponential size 2n, we will need to use a repeated counting technique to estimate its norm. Both of these approaches reduce to preparing the quantum states\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03d5(i)l \u232a = (\u220fj=i\u22121j=0 P\u0393P j%2k B)P\u0393Pk |vl\u27e9 for i = 0, . . . ,m and l = 1, . . . ,nv.

            "text": "Algorithm 1 returns a Betti number estimate \u03c7k for each order k = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1. Our main result in Theorem 1 shows that, for the appropriate choice of m and nv, this estimate is a BNE with an additive error \u03f5 \u2208 (0, 1). Here we present the detailed proof of this theorem.\nProof: The proof of the theorem comprises of two parts. The first is related to the error due to the stochastic trace estimator. The random state vector in our algorithm |vl\u27e9 = |hc(l)\u27e9 is some random Hadamard column with c(l) defining the random index, then the estimate \u27e8hc(l)|A|hc(l)\u27e9 can be viewed as a uniform random sample of the transformed matrix M = HAHT with the Hadamard matrix H , i.e., \u27e8hc(l)|A|hc(l)\u27e9 = \u27e8ec(l)|M |ec(l)\u27e9 where |el\u27e9 are basis vectors. Hence, we can use the analysis of unit vector estimators in Avron & Toledo (2011) to obtain error bounds. In particular, we apply Theorem 16 of Avron & Toledo (2011).\nLemma 1. (Avron & Toledo, 2011, Theorem 16) Assume we are given a Hermitian matrix A \u2208 RN\u00d7N , error tolerance \u03f5 \u2208 (0, 1) and probability parameter \u03b7 \u2208 (0, 1). Then, for random state vectors |vl\u27e9 = |hc(l)\u27e9 as random Hadamard columns, l = 1, . . . ,nv, and for nv \u2265 r 2 H(A) log(2/\u03b7)\n\u03f52\nwhere rH(A) = maxiAii, we have\nP (\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 1nv nv\u2211 l=1 \u27e8vl|A|vl\u27e9 \u2212 trace(A) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u03f5 \u00b7N ) \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b7 . (12)\nThe proof follows from the arguments establishing Theorem 16 in Avron & Toledo (2011), where we set t = \u03f5 \u00b7N in the Hoeffding\u2019s inequality, the samples take values in the interval [0,maxiMii], and we know Mii = N \u00b7Aii since H has orthogonal columns with \u2225hi\u22252 = N . The second part is due to the error in the Chebyshev polynomial approximation of the step function. For our analysis, since the step function is a discontinuous function, we consider a surrogate function to approximate using the Chebyshev polynomials. In particular, we consider the following\npolynomial, which was considered in Musco & Musco (2015) for the analysis of Krylov subspace methods.\nLemma 2 (Chebyshev Minimizing Polynomial (Musco & Musco, 2015)). Let \u03b1 > 0 be a specified parameter, and the gap \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1], and let q \u2265 1. Then, there exists a degree m polynomial p(x) such that:\n\u2022 p((1 + \u03b3)\u03b1) = (1 + \u03b3)\u03b1,\n\u2022 p(x) \u2265 x for all x \u2265 (1 + \u03b3)\u03b1, \u2022 |p(x)| \u2264 \u03b1\n2m \u221a\n\u03b3\u22121 for all x \u2208 [0, \u03b1].\nFurthermore, when q is odd, the polynomial only contains odd powered monomials and the polynomial is given by\np(x) = (1 + \u03b3)\u03b1 Tm(x/\u03b1)\nTm(1 + \u03b3) .\nHere Tm(x) is the m-degree Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind. Utilizing this polynomial, we have the following result.\nProposition 1. The Betti number estimate \u03be given by\n\u03be = trace(p\u0303(\u2206\u0303k))\n|Sk| , (13)\nwhere p\u0303(x) = p(1 \u2212 x) and p(\u00b7) is the polynomial in Lemma 2, for parameters \u03b1 = (1 \u2212 \u03b4), and \u03b3 = \u03b41\u2212\u03b4 and a degree m \u2265 log(1/\u03f5)\u221a \u03b4\n, satisfies\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03be \u2212 \u03b2k|Sk| \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u03f5.\nProof. Suppose the eigenvalues of \u2206\u0303k are in the interval {0}\u222a [\u03b4, 1], then the eigenvalues of I\u2212 \u2206\u0303k will be in the interval [0, 1\u2212 \u03b4] \u222a {1}, and by Lemma 2 with \u03b1 = (1\u2212 \u03b4) and \u03b3 = \u03b41\u2212\u03b4 , we have\n\u03b2k \u2212 |Sk| \u03b1\n2m \u221a \u03b3\u22121 \u2264 trace(p\u0303(\u2206\u0303k)) \u2264 \u03b2k + |Sk|\n\u03b1\n2m \u221a \u03b3\u22121 ,\nsince (1 + \u03b3)\u03b1 = 1 and the function is |p\u0303(x)| \u2264 \u03b1 2m \u221a \u03b3\u22121 for all x \u2208 [\u03b4, 1]. For selecting an appropriate degree m, we want \u03b1 2m \u221a \u03b3\u22121 \u2264 \u03f5, for which m \u2265 log(\u03b1/\u03f5)\u221a\u03b3 suffices. By substituting the values we conclude that\nm \u2265 log(1/\u03f5)\u221a \u03b4\nsuffices. Next, suppose we want to construct the above polynomial on a quantum computer, then in place of the step function as suggested in the previous section, we need to build p\u0303(x) = p(1 \u2212 x) from the moments xj , j = 0, . . . ,m. From the lemma, we have p\u0303(x) = (1 + \u03b3)\u03b1Tm((1\u2212x)/\u03b1)Tm(1+\u03b3) , and so, we need to construct Tm((1 \u2212 x)/\u03b1) from xj , j = 0, . . . ,m. For this we use the following expression of the Chebyshev polynomial:\nTm(x) = m m\u2211 j=0 (\u22122)j (m+ j \u2212 1)! (m\u2212 j)!2j! (1\u2212 x) j .\nThus, we can form Tm((1\u2212 x)/\u03b1) = m m\u2211 j=0 (\u22122)j (m+ j \u2212 1)! (m\u2212 j)!2j! (x\u2212 \u03b4) j \u2248 m m\u2211 j=0 (\u22122)j (m+ j \u2212 1)! (m\u2212 j)!2j! (x j \u2212 j\u03b4xj\u22121),\nsince \u03b1 = 1\u2212 \u03b4 and \u03b4 \u226a 1.\nWe are now ready to complete the proof of the main theorem. The stochastic Chebyshev method approximates the trace as tracenv(p\u0303(\u2206\u0303k)) = 1 nv \u2211 l\u27e8vl|p\u0303(\u2206\u0303k)|vl\u27e9, for random vector states |vl\u27e9. The Betti number estimate \u03c7k can then be written as \u03c7k = tracenv (p\u0303(\u2206\u0303k))\n|Sk| . We therefore need to bound \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c7k \u2212 \u03b2k|Sk| \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = 1|Sk| \u2223\u2223\u2223tracenv(p\u0303(\u2206\u0303k))\u2212 \u03b2k\u2223\u2223\u2223 . By triangle inequality, we have\u2223\u2223\u2223tracenv(p\u0303(\u2206\u0303k))\u2212 \u03b2k\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u2223\u2223\u2223tracenv(p\u0303(\u2206\u0303k))\u2212 trace(p\u0303(\u2206\u0303k))\u2223\u2223\u2223+ \u2223\u2223\u2223trace(p\u0303(\u2206\u0303k))\u2212 \u03b2k)\u2223\u2223\u2223 . From Lemma 1, since the maximum diagonal entry of \u2206\u0303k is 1, the size is |Sk and |p\u0303(x)| \u2264 1 for x \u2208 [0, 1], and we obtain for nv = O( log(2/\u03b7)\u03f52 )\u2223\u2223\u2223tracenv(p\u0303(\u2206\u0303k))\u2212 trace(p\u0303(\u2206\u0303k))\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u03f5 \u00b7 |Sk|. Moreover, from Proposition 1, we have\u2223\u2223\u2223trace(p\u0303(\u2206\u0303k))\u2212 \u03b2k\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u03f5 \u00b7 |Sk|. Additional errors: In addition to these errors, during the actual hardware implementation, we will encounter additional errors due to noise. Two sources of noise exist, namely (a) shot noise due to measurement and (b) hardware noise. The shot noise is typically modelled using a Gaussian assumption, and hence is assumed to reduce as O(1/ \u221a T ) for T repeated measurements/shots. This implies that the moments we compute will have errors. Suppose the additive error/noise in the moment computations is \u03f5T after T shots and the noise is independent. That is, each moment we\ncompute \u2329 \u03d5 (i) l \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03d5(i)l \u232a = \u27e8vl|\u2206ik |vl\u27e9 \u00b1 \u03f5T for i = 0, . . . ,m. Since we normalize the moments, we have \u00b5(i)l = 1 ni \u2329 \u03d5 (i) l\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03d5(i)l \u232a = 1ni (\u27e8vl|\u2206ik |vl\u27e9\u00b1 \u03f5T ). Then, when we stitch these moments together to compute the Chebyshev moments, we have these errors propagate as\n\u03b8 (j) l = j/2 j/2\u2211 i=0 (\u22121)i (j \u2212 i\u2212 1)! (j \u2212 2i)!i! ( 2 n )j\u22122i (\u27e8vl|\u2206j\u22122ik |vl\u27e9 \u00b1 \u03f5T ).\nThen, the error due to shot noise in the normalized Betti number estimation \u03c7k = 1 \u2212 1 nv|Sk| \u2211nv l=1 [\u2211m j=0 cj\u03b8 (j) l ] , under independent noise assumption, will be\nerrshot = 1 |Sk| m\u2211 j=0 cj(j/2) j/2\u2211 i=0 (\u22121)i (j \u2212 i\u2212 1)! (j \u2212 2i)!i! ( 2 n )j\u22122i \u03f5T \u2264 m |Sk| m/2\u2211 i=0 (m\u2212 i\u2212 1)! (m\u2212 2i)!i! ( 2 n )m\u22122i \u03f5T ,\nsince for the step function we have |cj | \u2264 (2/j). Next, let us consider m/2\u2211 i=0 (m\u2212 i\u2212 1)! (m\u2212 2i)!i! ( 2 n )m\u22122i = m/2\u22121\u2211 i=1 (m\u2212 i\u2212 1)! (m\u2212 2i)!i! ( 2 n )m\u22122i + 2 m + 1 m ( 2 n )m\n= m/2\u22121\u2211 i=1 1 i ( m\u2212 i\u2212 1 m\u2212 2i )( 2 n )m\u22122i + 2 m + 1 m ( 2 n )m \u2264 m/2\u22121\u2211 i=1 ( 2e(m\u2212 i\u2212 1) (m\u2212 2i)n )m\u22122i + 2 \u2264 m/2\u22121\u2211 i=1 ( 2m n )m\u22122i + 2 = m/2\u22121\u2211 i=0 ( 2m n )2i + 1 = 1\u2212 (2m/n)m 1\u2212 (2m/n)2 + 1 \u2264 2(n/2m)2 (n/2m)2 \u2212 1 .\nThe third line assumes m,n \u2265 2 and we have ( n k ) \u2264 (ne/k)k. The fourth line is because the maximum value of (m\u2212i\u22121)(m\u22122i) is m/4 at i = m/2\u2212 1. We assume n \u2265 2m in the final inequality, and for any n,m such that (n/2m)2 \u2265 2, the above term is \u2264 4. Then, the shot noise error will be\nerrshot \u2264 4m\n|Sk| \u03f5T .\nWe require the above error term to be comparable to \u03f5. We assume |Sk| is very large (exponential in n) and m \u2265 log(1/\u03f5)/ \u221a \u03b4 = \u221a n/\u03b4k log(1/\u03f5), and thus the error term due to shot noise will be small for \u03f5T < 1.\nThe hardware noise is much more difficult to characterize, since it is hardware and technology dependent. Therefore, in order to account for errors due to these two sources of noise, we will need to repeat the whole experiment several times and draw statistics to compute the Betti numbers.\nCombining the results yields the desired bound in the theorem."

            "text": "We now discuss the circuit and computational complexities of our proposed algorithm and show that it is NISQ implementable under certain conditions, such as clique-dense complexes which commonly occur for large resolution scale and high order k. The main quantum component of our algorithm comprises the computation of the moments \u00b5(i)l = 1 ni \u27e8vl|\u2206ik |vl\u27e9, for i = 0, . . . ,m =\nO(log(1/\u03f5)/ \u221a \u03b4), and the computation of the nv = O(\u03f5\u22122) random Hadamard vectors. The random Hadamard state preparation requires n single-qubit Hadamard gates in parallel and O(1) time.\nNext, for a given k, constructing the combinatorial Laplacian \u2206k involves simulating the boundary operatorB and constructing the projectors P\u0393 and Pk. The operatorB, involving the sum of n Pauli operators, can be simulated as eiB using a circuit with 1 ancillary qubit and O(n) gates. Hence, the time complexity will also be O(n). For the projectors, constructing Pk requires O(n log2 n) gates, and this succeeds for a random order k. Then for P\u0393, we need to find all the simplices that are in the complex \u0393. This is achieved using n/2 qubits in parallel and n \u2212 1 operations, and thus the time complexity remains O(n). The number of gates required will be O(n2\u03b6\u0304k), recalling \u03b6\u0304k := min{1 \u2212 \u03b6k, \u03b6k}. The procedure of applying the projectors succeeds with probability 1/\u03b6k, and we obtain the projection onto all simplicies of order k that is in \u0393, for a random k. Hence, the projectors together require O(n2) gates, while the depth remains O(n), and the time complexity for a projection will be O ( n \u03b6k ) , since P\u0393 succeeds when run O(\u03b6\u22121k ) times. For higher moments, we need to construct \u2206ik up to the power m = O(log(1/\u03f5)/ \u221a \u03b4). Therefore,\nthe circuit has a total gate complexity of O(n2 log(1/\u03f5)/ \u221a \u03b4) with a depth of O(n log(1/\u03f5)/ \u221a \u03b4). In order to compute \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03d5(i)l \u232a for a given degree (i), we need all 2 \u00b7 (i) applications of P\u0393 to succeed simultaneously, and therefore we need to run the projections O(\u03b6\u22122(i)k ) times. The first projection Pk yields a random order k, and the subsequent projections onto a simplicial order needed for higher moments will also have to be onto the same order k. Due to the application of the boundary operator B, the subsequent simplicial order projections will result in a projection onto one of the simplicial orders k\u22121 or k+1 (after one application) and k\u22122, k or k+2 (after two applications). Hence, we need to repeatedly apply the order projection (a constant number of times) in order to ensure that we are operating on the right order (in addition to the complex projection). The procedure of computing the m moments is repeated nv = O(\u03f5\u22122) times with different random Hadamard column vectors, and thus the total time complexity of our algorithm to compute the BNE \u03c7k is given by\nO\n( n log(1/\u03f5)\n\u221a \u03b4\u03f52\u03b6 2 log(1/\u03f5)/ \u221a \u03b4\nk\n) .\nSuppose \u03b4k is the spectral gap of \u2206k and \u2206\u0303k = \u2206kn , then \u03b4 = \u03b4k n . Note that we consider above a simple approach of repeating the projection until it succeeds each time, since this requires a shortdepth circuit and results in a \u03b6\u22122 log(1/\u03f5)k term in the time complexity. Perhaps, this procedure can be improved to reduce the complexity further. We consider clique-dense complexes (i.e., large \u03b6k, as\ndiscussed in the next section), and this term is a constant for a given set {\u03f5, \u03b4, \u03b6k} and is independent of n."

            "text": "Table 1 summarizes the circuit and computational complexities of our algorithm and compares them to that for the QTDA algorithm of Lloyd et al. (2016). As remarked earlier, the gate and time complexities for this QTDA algorithm reported in Gyurik et al. (2020) and Gunn & Kornerup (2019) are different from those reported in Lloyd et al. (2016), since Gyurik et al. and Gunn & Kornerup both assume the operator B\u0303 is given and thus they add the complexities of the two steps (Grover\u2019s algorithm and QPE); refer to Remark 1 above.\nOur proposed Algorithm 1 is NISQ implementable whenever the Laplacian spectral gap is large, representing the only algorithm that is able to do so.\nSimplices/Clique dense complexes: We first discuss examples of complexes that are simplices/clique dense. Gyurik et al. (2020) presented a few examples of a family of graphs that are clique-dense. Using the clique-density theorem (Reiher, 2016), we can consider a class of graphs/complexes that are clique-dense. Let \u03b3 > k\u221222(k\u22121) be a constant. Then, for a graph with n nodes and \u03b3n2 edges and for a given order k \u2265 3, we have |Sk| = \u2126(nk+1) by the cliquedensity theorem (Reiher, 2016). If \u03b3 \u2265 k\u22121k , then the graph will be even denser. Such clique-dense complexes occur in TDA when the resolution scale \u03b5 is large (close to maximum distance between points), and therefore QTDA algorithms can achieve a significant speedup for BNE over classical algorithms, particularly when we are interested in larger (and many) orders of k. We also refer to the discussions in Lloyd et al. (2016); Gyurik et al. (2020) on when quantum TDA algorithms are advantageous.\nLaplacian spectral gap: We next discuss different settings, namely when the Laplacian of a given simplicial complex has a sufficiently large spectral gap such that a small degree m will suffice for BNE. Not much is known for general simplicial complexes in terms of lower bounds for \u03b4, the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the combinatorial Laplacians (Gyurik et al., 2020). However, we can identify many specific examples of simplicial complexes for which \u03b4 can be large. Indeed, several articles (Goldberg, 2002; Horak & Jost, 2013; Yamada, 2019; Lew, 2020a;b) have studied the spectra of the Laplacian of different simplicial complexes, including random simplicial complexes (Gundert & Wagner, 2016; Kahle, 2016; Knowles & Rosenthal, 2017; Adhikari et al., 2020; Beit-Aharon & Meshulam, 2020).\nSome specific complexes: First, let us consider a few specific types of simplicial complexes. The articles by Horak & Jost (2013) and Yamada (2019) consider the Laplacian spectra of k-regular complexes and orientable complexes. A simplicial complex \u0393 is k-regular if and only if all of its kfaces have the same degree dk, whereas a k+1-dimensional simplicial complex \u0393 is orientable if and only if all k-faces of \u0393 have orientation such that any two simplices which intersect on a (k \u2212 1)- face induce a different orientation on that face. For k-regular simplicial complexes with degree dk = 1, the Laplacian \u2206k has all nonzero eigenvalues equal to k + 2. Horak & Jost (2013) show similar results for higher degree and for orientable k-dimensional simplicial complexes. Yamada (2019) presents lower bounds on the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian for these two types of complexes in terms of the Ricci curvature (Bauer et al., 2011) of the complex. For an orientable k-dimensional simplicial complex \u0393 with maximum degree dk for the (k \u2212 1)-faces, the smallest\nnonzero eigenvalues of \u2206k, denoted by \u03b4k, satisfies\n\u03b4k \u2265 (k + 1)(\u03bac \u2212 1) + 2\ndk ,\nwhere \u03bac is the Ricci curvature on \u0393. If the complex is orientable k-regular, then the minimal eigenvalues of \u2206k satisfies \u03b4k \u2265 (k+1)\u03bac. We refer to Yamada (2019) for bounds on the Ricci curvature \u03bac for k-regular complexes. Such complexes therefore can have a large spectral gap between zero and nonzero eigenvalues (i.e., large \u03b4 for the scaled Laplacian) when k is sufficiently large.\nNext, the article by Goldberg (2002) considers the Laplacian spectra of a few specific complexes. For a finite simplicial complex \u0393 that contains distinct flapoid clusters of size dc, the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian are all equal to dc = o(n). The article by Lew (2020b) presents a lower bound for the spectral gap of the k-Laplacian \u2206k for complexes without missing faces. In particular, for an nvertex simplicial complex \u0393 without missing faces of dimension larger than \u2113, the smallest nonzero eigenvalue (spectral gap) of \u2206k, for k \u2264 \u2113, satisfies\n\u03b4k \u2265 (\u2113+ 1)(dk + k + 1)\u2212 \u2113n, where dk is the minimal degree of a k-simplex in \u0393. These complexes therefore can also have a large spectral gap, under appropriate conditions.\nRandom complexes: Let us now consider random simplicial complexes. For a random complex \u0393 with n vertices and constants C1, C2 and p \u2265 (k + C1) log(n)/n, Gundert & Wagner (2016) show that, if the expected degree of k \u2212 1 faces is dk := p(n \u2212 k), then the normalized Laplacian12 \u2206\u0302k has all its nonzero eigenvalues in the interval[\n1\u2212 C2\u221a dk , 1 + C2\u221a dk\n] ,\nwith high probability. It was recently shown by Adhikari et al. (2020) that, for random dense graphs/complexes, the limiting spectral gap (between zero and nonzero eigenvalues) of the normalized Laplacian approaches 1/2. Another interesting and relevant result related to the spectra of random complexes was obtained by Beit-Aharon & Meshulam (2020), who consider random subset complexes. Suppose \u0393 is a full complex (also called a homological sphere) with all possible simplices of order up to n\u2212 1, i.e., an n-simplex. Let G\u0303 be a random subset of \u0393, G\u0303 \u2282 \u0393, of size n\u0303 and let \u03b4k be the minimal (smallest nonzero) eigenvalue of the k-Laplacian \u2206k of G\u0303 for k < n. Then, for k \u2265 1 and \u03be > 0, if the size n\u0303 = \u2308 4k2 logn\u03be2 \u2309, we have (Beit-Aharon & Meshulam, 2020)\nP [\u03b4k < (1\u2212 \u03be)n\u0303] \u2264 O ( 1\nn\n) .\nThese results therefore suggest that random dense complexes will likely have a large spectral gap between zero and nonzero eigenvalues. Indeed, this is exactly the regime (large \u03b6k) where the quantum algorithms are advantageous. As discussed by Lloyd (1996), such dense complexes occur in TDA when the resolution scale \u03b5 is large. For such complexes, our proposed QTDA algorithm has great prospects to be NISQ implementable.\nApproximate BNE: When the spectral gap of the Laplacian \u2206\u0303k is not larger than the chosen threshold \u03b4, our NISQ-QTDA algorithm estimates an approximate Betti number by counting the (larger) eigenvalues above the threshold \u03b4. This was defined in Gyurik et al. (2020) as the problem of approximate Betti number estimation (ABNE). Such ABNE will be useful in certain situations, since our method provides an approach to filter out small (noisy) eigenvalues and only consider larger (dominant) eigenvalues for estimating the Betti number. These small nonzero eigenvalues occur when there are thinly (loosely) connected components in the complex. Such connections likely occur when the resolution scale \u03b5 is small, and they might not persist when \u03b5 increases. Our approach therefore provides a way to filter out noise and estimate the features that persist at larger resolution scale. Moreover, we note that computing the moments of the Laplacians \u2206k (exponential in size) for different k is non-trivial, and these moments can be used as features for certain downstream learning tasks, for example.\n12The normalized Laplacian is defined as \u2206\u0302k := D\u22121k \u2206k, where Dk is the diagonal matrix with the degrees of the faces as its diagonal entries."

Figure 8 (A and B) plot the Betti number estimated as a function of the Chebyshev polynomial degree m for two classes of simplicial complexes, respectively. The first class in Figure 8(A) correspond to complexes that have stable shape (well connected), as in if we remove few edges, the shape (and hence the Betti numbers) do not change. The Laplacian corresponding to such complexes have a large spectral gap. We note that the Betti number estimated by our method for such complexes are fairly accurate and a small degree polynomial approximation suffices to get a good estimate of the Betti numbers. The black dash lines are the true Betti numbers and the star-solid lines correspond to the Betti numbers estimated for four different complexes all with 8 vertices, respectively (2 squares, 4 squares, 6 squares/cube and 2 squares with diagonals included).\nThe second class in Figure 8(B) correspond to complexes that have weak connections, such that removing a few edges changes the shapes (and Betti numbers) significantly. Such complexes have relatively Laplacian small spectral gap. We note that, we require a higher degree approximation for accurate Betti number estimation. We considered four different complexes (1 square and 4 dangling points, 2 squares with two edges connecting them, 3 squares, and 5 squares). Interestingly, we observe that the Betti vs. degree curves for the 3 similar complexes have a similar shape and we can be distinguish between them, even though the Betti numbers estimated are not correct. This shows our method is provides a way to distinguish complexes/shape even with a low degree approximation.\nFigure 8(C) plots the Hellinger distance (a measure of fidelity) of our NISQ-QTDA circuit as a function of the circuit depth, i.e., number of vertices/qubits for different noise levels in simulations.\nThe square Hellinger distance between two probability measures P and Q is defined as\nH2(P,Q) = 1\n2\n\u222b (\u221a dP \u2212 \u221a dQ )2 .\nIn the figure, we consider the Hellinger distance between the measured probabilities using noiseless simulations and noisy simulations. Four different noise levels were considered. The noise-level pairs show the 1-qubit and 2-qubit gate error rates. The measurement error rate was set to be same as the 2-qubit gate error rate. We plot the Hellinger distance restricted to the top 10% of the noise-free outcomes, thereby focusing only those outcomes with sufficient probability mass at the given shot count. As expected, the Fidelity/noise-error increases as the circuit depth (and number of qubits) increase."

            "text": "The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is the remnant after-glow of the Big Bang, forming an opaque background curtain in the sky. The curtain dates back to when the Universe was about 380, 000 years old (redshift z \u2248 1100) when the universe first became transparent to radiation. CMB photons produce a nearly perfect black-body spectrum with a present day temperature of around 2.725 K (Aghanim et al., 2020). This temperature fluctuates by around one part in 104 depending upon the angle in the sky one looks. The uniformity corroborates an epoch of cosmological inflation and provides a window into physics in the early Universe. Recalling that a function \u03d5 is Gaussian when the vector v\u20d7 = (\u03d5(x1), . . . , \u03d5(xn)) is drawn from an n-dimensional Gaussian distribution for all n and for all xi, of particular interest are deviations from Gaussianity in the CMB. These are typically assessed by looking at three-point and four-point correlation functions, the spatial bispectrum and trispectrum. An application of TDA compares simulations of the CMB with a Gaussian probability distribution to those with particular local injections of non-Gaussianity, e.g., by considering \u03c6(x) = \u03d5(x) + fNL ( \u03d5(x)\u2212 \u27e8\u03d5\u27e9 )2 , with \u03d5(x) a Gaussian field and fNL a parameter capturing the amount of non-Gaussianity. Preliminary investigations in this direction using classical TDA include (Cole & Shiu, 2018a; Feldbrugge et al., 2019a; Biagetti et al., 2021), and the present state of the art detects fNL \u223c O(10). Benchmarking against different values of fNL, NISQ-TDA could compute higher-order Betti numbers associated with the actual sky and test for non-Gaussianity in the CMB to a potentially greater degree of sensitivity.\nHere, we present preliminary results to illustrate how we might apply the insights of Adler et al. (2014) (for example drawing high-dimensional points and excluding the \u2018core\u2019) for the detection of non-Gaussianity in the CMB data. We consider random sets of n = 64 sample points in three dimensions from Gaussian and exponential distributions. The visualization of the data distributions in 3D and the norm distributions are presented in Figure 9 (first two rows). Our goal is to illustrate that by only using homological information (Betti numbers in the form of \u2018persistent diagrams\u2019) of very small sample sets (forced to have zero-mean and unit-variance, making the task much more\ndifficult), we can still distinguish the two distributions. Furthermore, we wish to show that each extra Betti number considered boosts the accuracy. Such an illustration would suggest that we can detect non-Gaussianity in CMB data using NISQ-QTDA to a greater degree than low-order classical TDA since QTDA furnishes all high probability Betti numbers of any order.\nIn order to run our experiment, we use the GUDHI (Maria et al., 2014) package for Betti number estimation of the data at different resolutions \u03b5 to create the persistence diagrams (representing occurrence/birth and disappearance/death of holes at resolution scale \u03b5). See the last row of Figure 9 for an example output of the GUDHI pipeline. Directly visualizing the points and the norm distributions illustrates that the distinguishability task is non-trivial (especially when the form of the distribution is unknown). Secondly, it is only when viewing the persistence diagrams (PDs) does the differing behavior become easier to detect. However, a single sample set\u2019s associated PD is unlikely to be rigorously helpful in telling apart another single sample set. Fortunately, in the simulation use-case as well as for the real CMB data (considering it\u2019s presumed rotational invariance) we may repeatedly draw sample sets, creating a set of PDs to train and test on. Therefore, we next employ a Bayesian (learning) package called BayesTDA (Maroulas et al., 2020) with train (30) and test (20) sample sets, to calculate two Poisson point-process posteriors from the training data, allowing for the calculation of the Bayesian likelihoods of the test data given the two competing posteriors, and culminating in a single Bayes factor for each test data set. The Bayes factors can then be used for classification by comparing to a threshold. To obviate the choice of a threshold we simply calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) measure of classification accuracy (0.5 is as bad as random guessing and 1 is perfect classification).\nIn Figure 10, we present the Bayes factors and AUC obtained for the data distributions when \u03b21 (top left), \u03b22 (top right) and both \u03b21 and \u03b22 combined (bottom) were used in the learning model. We observe that we can clearly distinguish the two distributions using the Bayes factors. Moreover, we note that the different Betti numbers contain independent valuable information. Therefore, by potentially computing all relevant Betti numbers of the CMB data using NISQ-QTDA, and using the above approach, we expect to detect non-Gaussianity in the CMB data to higher sensitivity levels than is possible classically (since even for moderate numbers of data points, we cannot compute higher order Betti numbers classically)."

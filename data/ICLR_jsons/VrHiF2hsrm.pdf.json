    "abstractText": "We lack a systematic understanding of the effects of fine-tuning (via methods such as instruction-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback), particularly on tasks outside the narrow fine-tuning distribution. In a simplified scenario, we demonstrate that improving performance on tasks within the fine-tuning data distribution comes at the expense of capabilities on other tasks. We hypothesize that language models implicitly infer the task of the prompt and that fine-tuning skews this inference towards tasks in the fine-tuning distribution. To test this, we propose Conjugate Prompting, which artificially makes the task look farther from the fine-tuning distribution while requiring the same capability, and we find that this recovers some of the pretraining capabilities on our synthetic setup. Since real-world fine-tuning distributions are predominantly English, we apply conjugate prompting to recover pretrained capabilities in LLMs by simply translating the prompts to different languages. This allows us to recover the in-context learning abilities lost via instruction tuning, and more concerningly, recover harmful content generation suppressed by safety fine-tuning in chatbots like ChatGPT.",

            "text": "Developing large language models (LLMs) typically involves two stages\u2014pretraining (next token prediction) on vast text corpora and fine-tuning on curated datasets. Fine-tuning through methods such as instruction-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback is critical in enabling language models to output desirable text. Since fine-tuning datasets are considerably smaller and less diverse than web-scale pretraining datasets, and there is always a risk that the fine-tuned model \u201ccatastrophically forgets\u201d (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989) how to solve tasks that the pretrained model could solve. Such a gap has been reported as an \u201calignment tax\u201d (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022), but there is no clear understanding of what these trade-offs are and how to mitigate them. In this work, we introduce a synthetic setup to understand the effects of fine-tuning. Building on the prior work of in-context learning linear functions (Garg et al., 2023) by pretraining transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) on a large number of weight vectors, we show that the resulting models can be sub-optimal when evaluated on a few weight vectors of special interest. This mirrors real-world settings where the uncurated pretraining data contains some \u201cnatural\u201d tasks of special interest, like question answering. Fine-tuning on the weights (tasks) of interest enables transformers to achieve optimal performance on these tasks at the cost of worse performance on other tasks. We find that the most affected tasks are outside but \u201cclose\u201d to the fine-tuning distribution as measured by their likelihood under the fine-tuning distribution. In other words, the fine-tuned model performs more like the pretrained model on tasks that are far from the fine-tuning distribution. We hypothesize this is because models are implicitly \u201cinferring\u201d the task before solving the corresponding task, and that fine-tuning skews model task inference more than it changes models capabilities. Assuming this framework, we can recover the suppressed pretraining capability through Conjugate Prompting. For a prompt P outside the fine-tuning distribution, we prompt the language model with prompt P \u2032 such that (i) P \u2032 is less likely under the fine-tuning distribution and (ii) the solution to prompt P can be easily recovered from the solution to prompt P \u2032. Since P \u2032 is farther from the fine-tuning distribution than P , the fine-tuned model will solve P \u2032 with the pretrained capability, allowing us to extract a better solution for the original prompt P . We test conjugate prompting in the linear regression setup and find that it alleviates some of the trade-offs induced by fine-tuning.\nCode available at [REDACTED]\nDrawing inspiration from the synthetic experiments, we validate whether fine-tuning similarly affects real language models. Since fine-tuning datasets are primarily in English, we apply conjugate prompting with language translation to lower the likelihood of being drawn from the fine-tuning distribution while preserving the core task. We construct a problem that can either be solved by in-context learning or following an instruction and find that instruction-tuning suppresses in-context learning. Across 5 models and 4 non-English languages (with 2 additional transformations), conjugate prompting recovers the pretrained capability of in-context learning. We also consider the problem of harmful content generation where chatbots like ChatGPT are fine-tuned to refuse harmful instructions: here it is in an adversary\u2019s interest to recover suppressed pretraining capability of following the instruction. We find that conjugate prompting can still circumvent the fine-tuned capability of refusal of harmful instructions and recover some of the pretrained capability of following the instruction."

Our setup tries to mirror the structure of large language model training by pretraining over a broad class of many tasks, from the distribution Dcont, and a special set of few tasks, from the distribution Ddisc (Section 2.4). When we fine-tune the model to improve performance over Ddisc, the model seems to \u201cforget\u201d the capability to solve tasks from Dcont (Section 2.5). However, we hypothesize that these capabilities are actually \u201csuppressed\u201d (Sections 2.6 and 2.7), and we find that we can recover them through our principled conjugate prompting strategy (Section 2.8)."

            "text": "We are interested in learning functions f \u2208 F that map inputs x \u2208 Rd to outputs y \u2208 R. Inspired by previous works (Garg et al., 2023; Akyu\u0308rek et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023), we focus on linear regression for noisy data, where every function is given by fw : x 7\u2192 \u27e8w, x\u27e9 for a fixed w \u2208 Rd. We are given a set of samples S of variable length k from 0 to maximum length N such that\nS = {(x1, y1), . . . , (xk, yk)} , (1)\nwith yi = fw(xi)+ \u03f5i and \u03f5i \u223c N (0, \u03c32). From this, a model estimates the output yquery for a given input xquery. We will refer to an instance from our function class fw as a task, and when it is clear from context, we will refer to tasks by the associated weight vector w. In this section, all inputs will be sampled from the normal distribution via xi \u223c N (0, Id).\nTraining an auto-regressive model. We consider auto-regressive models T\u03b8 that take in a sequence of tokens, each in Rd, to produce a real-valued output. For samples S generated under w as\nFigure 2: Pretraining loss. We compare a model trained on Dcont against the optimal algorithm of ridge regression (left) and a model trained on Ddisc of 64 tasks against the optimal algorithm of discrete regression (right). Transformers match Bayes-optimal.\nin Equation 1, we feed T\u03b8 the prompt [x1, y1, . . . , xk, yk, xquery]1 and take its output y\u0302 as a prediction of yquery. When appropriate, we will refer to the xi\u2019s in the prompt as X \u2208 Rk\u00d7d and the yi\u2019s as y \u2208 Rk. We train and evaluate T\u03b8 with respect to a weight distribution D via the quadratic loss\nL(\u03b8,D) = N\u2211\nk=0\nE xi\u223cN (0,Id)\nw\u223cD \u03f5i\u223cN (0,\u03c32)\n[ (T\u03b8 ([x1, y1, . . . , xk, yk, xquery])\u2212 yquery)2 ] . (2)\nby sampling a fresh batch of x,w, \u03f5 in each step. Under the quadratic loss, the optimal output is E [fw(xquery) + \u03f5 | X, y] = \u27e8E [w | X, y] , xquery\u27e9. For our model, we use a 22.4 million paramater GPT-2 style transformer. For more experimental details, refer to Appendix C.8.\n2.2 GAUSSIAN PRIOR OVER WEIGHTS (DCONT)\nPrior work on learning linear functions (Garg et al., 2023; Akyu\u0308rek et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023) assumes weights are sampled from a Gaussian prior Dcont = N (0, \u03c42Id), which we will refer to as the \u201ccontinuous distribution\u201d. In this case, the Bayes optimal predictor performs ridge regression:\nw\u2217cont(X, y) = E [w | X, y] = ( X\u22a4X + \u03c32\n\u03c42 Id\n)\u22121 X\u22a4y. (3)\nAs noted in prior work ((Garg et al., 2023; Akyu\u0308rek et al., 2022)), for most values of \u03c4, \u03c3, a converged transformer\u2019s predictions closely match the Bayes optimal predictor when evaluated on weight vectors from the same Gaussian prior. We replicate this for \u03c4 = 1 in Figure 2, left.\n2.3 DISCRETE PRIOR OVER FIXED WEIGHTS (DDISC)\nThe Gaussian prior spreads probability mass over a large region of weight vectors, but in real world distributions, there isn\u2019t such a \u201cuniform\u201d prior over the task space. Rather, there are a few common tasks (e.g. summarization or sentiment analysis) which frequently appear in the task distribution, and pretrained LLMs utilize these priors (Min et al., 2022b; Wei et al., 2023b; Pan et al., 2023). We take this scenario to the extreme and consider training over a \u201cfixed\u201d set of weights with the distribution Ddisc sampling w uniformly from {w1, . . . , wn}. We refer to this as the \u201cdiscrete distribution\u201d. For our experiments, we set n = 64 and fix each wi as an independent sample of N (0, Id). With this new prior, ridge regression is no longer optimal. The Bayes optimal estimator for Ddisc is:\nw\u2217disc(X, y) = \u2211 w\u2208W w\u03c6 ((y \u2212Xw)/\u03c3)\u2211 w\u2208W \u03c6 ((y \u2212Xw)/\u03c3) , (4)\nwhere \u03c6 (\u00b7) is the density of the standard multivariate normal distribution (derivation in Appendix B.1). We refer to this estimator as discrete regression. After training for sufficiently many steps, we find that the Transformer achieves the same loss as the Bayes-optimal estimator w\u2217disc, clearly outperforming ridge regression on the fixed set of weights (Figure 2, right).\n2.4 PRETRAINING OVER THE MIXTURE (DMIX)\nWe know that web-scale pretraining data is heavy-tailed, consisting of some important tasks seen often (similar to Ddisc), as well a large number of diverse tasks each seen rarely (similar to Dcont). To best model this structure, we consider the \u201cmixture distribution\u201d\nDmix = \u03b1Ddisc + (1\u2212 \u03b1)Dcont (5) 1Every 1-dimensional token is right-padded with d\u2212 1 zeroes\nFigure 3: Trade-off over training. We measure the loss over Dcont and Ddisc for different models over different values of \u03b1. The black curve, mixture regression, faces a natural trade-off over different values of \u03b1. We also pretrain models for \u03b1 \u2208 {0.2, 0.5, 0.8} and measure their losses at 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 steps. The solid pink lines are trajectories over time for a fixed \u03b1 and the dotted pink lines are the trade-off for a fixed time step. Over the course of training, models approach mixture regression.\nfor a scalar \u03b1. The Bayes optimal estimator for this mixture distribution takes the form\nw\u2217mix(X, y) = g(X, y)w \u2217 disc(X, y) + (1\u2212 g(X, y))w\u2217cont(X, y), (6)\nwhere g(X, y) is the posterior that X, y was sampled from Ddisc (expression in Appendix B.1). Intuitively, this predictor utilizes ridge regression to get w\u2217cont and discrete regression to get w \u2217 disc which it appropriately weights by the posterior. We refer to this solution as mixture regression.\nMixture regression demonstrates a trade-off. We measure performance by evaluating loss on the continuous and discrete distributions, and we find a natural trade-off between performance on these distributions determined by the prior \u03b1 (Figure 3, black curve). Mixture regression weights ridge regression for \u03b1 close to 0 and discrete regression for \u03b1 close to 1. For intermediate \u03b1, mixture regression can utilize the posterior to infer the distribution and get low loss on both Dcont and Ddisc (Appendix C.5 discusses mixture regression\u2019s ability to infer the distribution in more detail).\nPretrained models approach mixture regression. As we train models on the mixture distribution, they approach the Bayes-optimal solution of mixture regression for the respective \u03b1. However, this convergence is very slow, especially for smaller values like \u03b1 = 0.2. Moreover, the trade-off bounds how well a converged model can do on the discrete distribution."

            "text": "In practice, there is a distributional mismatch between the tasks learned during pretraining and the tasks of interest to an end user. For example, next token prediction over the internet doesn\u2019t naturally respond to human-written instructions or avoid outputting toxic content. Additionally, pre-training on all tasks is not a data nor compute efficient way of improving performance on a target application. The most common solution is to fine-tune the pretrained model over the tasks of interest. We replicate this in our controlled setup by targeting performance on the fixed set of discrete tasks in Ddisc, which requires the model to perform discrete regression (Equation 4). Fine-tuning is necessary since pretraining is both inefficient and limited by the distributional mismatch.\nFine-tuning helps for Ddisc and hurts Dcont. Fine-tuning the pretrained models from Section 2.4 over Ddisc rapidly improves performance on Ddisc. However, this also leads to large performance drops on Dcont (pictured for \u03b1 = 0.5 in Figure 4). This is an instance of \u201ccatastrophic forgetting\u201d, where fine-tuning a model to improve at one task causes it to worsen at other tasks. Though this performance drop could imply that the model can not perform ridge regression anymore, we investigate how fine-tuning is affecting model predictions to recover lost performance on the continuous distribution. Figure 4: Fine-tuning hurts\ncontinuous loss. We train an \u03b1 = 0.2 transformer with 64 discrete tasks for 5000 steps and fine-tune for 400 steps on Ddisc (highlighted).

            "text": "To develop a deeper understanding of how fine-tuning enhances performance on Ddisc while damaging performance on Dcont, we analyze how the prompt influences the change in loss. We find that the change in loss incurred by fine-tuning is not uniform and depends on the likelihood that the prompt was sampled from the fine-tuning distribution Ddisc. In Figure 5, we see how the change in loss induced by fine-tuning varies with the likelihood of being drawn from the fine-tuning distribution. For prompts that are likely to be drawn from the fine-tuning distribution, the loss increases as we lower the likelihood. This lines up with the standard intuition that models will have stronger performance for inputs that are in-distribution and worse performance for inputs that are out-of-distribution. However, this trend does not continue forever and in fact reverses for the continuous prompts. As the likelihood continues to decrease, the model improves performance, running counter to standard intuition about out-of-distribution inputs. With this understanding of how fine-tuning affects model predictions unevenly, we can better probe what function the fine-tuned model has learned."

A capability refers to whether the transformer can internally perform an algorithm of interest (i.e. discrete regression or ridge regression) and task inference refers to whether the model can correctly disambiguate which algorithm to use. Due to limited mechanistic understanding, we can not test whether this is how language models compute solutions. However, we can utilize this as an assumption to understand what is learned by the model. Assuming this framework, catastrophic forgetting can be seen as task inference up-weighting finetuning tasks and potential degrading pretraining capabilities. However, from Figure 4, we see that the loss on Dcont jumps abruptly as we fine-tune, suggesting that the model is more likely to have learned to down-weight the ridge regression solution rather than completely \u201cunlearn\u201d any internal implementation of ridge regression within a few steps. We hypothesize that during fine-tuning, the drop in performance on the continuous distribution is largely driven by altered task inference, i.e. for a prompt X, y from Dcont, g\u03b8(X, y) is larger due to the fine-tuning updates.

Since a sufficiently large \u03b3 will decrease the true posterior g(X, y) for all \u03b1, we expect that g\u03b8(X, \u03b3y) would be lower than g\u03b8(X, y), weighting the output towards ridge regression. Under this scaling, the loss-optimal prediction for the scaled prompt X, \u03b3y would correspond to \u27e8\u03b3w, xquery\u27e9, which is the loss-optimal prediction for the prompt X, y scaled by \u03b3. Therefore, to make the model perform ridge regression, we compose our insights into the following prompting strategy. Instead of directly feeding our prompt into the model, we scale the labels \u03b3, feed\nthe model the scaled prompt, and scale down the model output. This should recover ridge regression if the model can perform ridge regression for the scaled prompt and if our hypothesis is true. This strategy is an instance of conjugate prompting, which we generalize in Section 3.\nConjugate prompting recovers ridge regression. We evaluate conjugate prompting Figure 6. In line with our hypothesis, conjugate prompting can help improve performance for fine-tuned models. Specifically, we observe that the strategy helps at low sample counts where the fine-tuned model is more uncertain if the prompt is from the continuous or discrete distribution. We suspect that at higher sample counts, the fine-tuned model has better inferred the task and conjugate prompting simply tests a harder task. Since we can get closer to ridge regression through conjugate prompting, we claim the ridge regression solution has not been \u201cforgotten\u201d but \u201csuppressed\u201d since it can be partially recovered through manipulating task inference."

Bottom: For harmful generation, each harmful instruction can be solved differently by inferring the prompt as an ANSWER task (answering the problem) or REFUSE task (refusing or answering a different question).\ncome at the cost of other capabilities such as in-context learning. This is particularly amplified when the two tasks are at conflict with each other. For example, suppose the prompt contains exemplars corresponding to a latent task, but the final query xquery takes the form of an instruction (such as What is 2 + 2?). How well do models perform in-context learning in this setting? To test this, we generate prompts using the template in Figure 7, where there are different solutions if the task is in-context learning (ICL) vs instruction following (IF). See Appendix E.1 for full details on how these prompts were generated and Appendix E.2 for concrete examples. We find that fine-tuned models are always less likely to perform in-context learning compared to their pretrained counterparts: Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) and Vicuna-7b (Chiang et al., 2023) perform ICL on 56.75% and 40.00% less inputs than LLaMa-7b (Touvron et al., 2023a) and OPT-IML-1.3b (Iyer et al., 2023) performs ICL on 21.00% less inputs than OPT-1.3b (Zhang et al., 2022). We can contextualize this drop in ICL with fine-tuning under the implicit inference framework of Section 2.7. Let L(prompt) denote the distribution over possible completions by a model L given prompt. Let LIF denote this distribution conditioned on a model that always follows instructions, and LICL be the same for ICL. As per our hypothesis, we can write our model L as\nL(prompt) = g\u03b8(prompt)LIF(prompt) + (1\u2212 g\u03b8(prompt))LICL(prompt),\nwhere the model internally estimates g\u03b8 which is the posterior likelihood of the model interpreting the latent task to be instruction following. Our hypothesis predicts that one reason instruction-tuned models are worse at ICL is because instruction-tuning increases g\u03b8 for most prompts, suppressing the in-context learning capability LICL. Note that there might also be a change in the internal representations of LICL and LIF, but we only focus on what can be recovered by simply manipulating the task inference. If our hypothesis holds, conjugate prompting (see Section 3) can reverse the effect of g and would cause the fine-tuned model to perform ICL more often.\nConjugate prompting to perform ICL over instruction following. We observe that the instruction tuning data for Alpaca, Vicuna, and OPT-IML is primarily in English. Therefore, translating to different languages satisfies the \u201clower likelihood\u201d property of conjugate prompting, as well as the \u201cinvertibility\u201d property because we can simply translate the answer to English 2. Furthermore,\n2Translation can violate invertibility for tasks that require contextual knowledge that varies across languages\nthe pretrained models we consider are capable of performing ICL in different languages. Other than language translation, we find that the additional transformations of Leetspeak and Pig Latin (also discussed in Wei et al. (2023a)) satisfy these properties. We test whether language translation biases the fine-tuned model more towards pretrained behavior of ICL. To do so, we compute the drop in ICL frequency between the English fine-tuned and pretrained counterparts across 5 models prompted under 4 non-English languages and 2 additional transformations in in Table 1 (translation implemented with Google Translate (Wu et al., 2016)). We see that translation always results in a smaller drop in ICL frequency compared to English prompts (except for by 0.25% for one model pair for one language). For example, with Alpaca, Leetspeak results in a drop of only 1.0%, French shows a drop of 29.00%, while in contrast English results in a much larger drop of 56.75%. This confirms that conjugate prompting can successfully shift task inference in practice. We provide a more detailed decomposition in Appendix E.3."

Since preference data is much more expensive and less diverse than pretraining data (Hao, 2023), we expect that fine-tuning is primarily in English, and we test conjugate prompting to recover language model behavior before safety fine-tuning. Specifically, we test GPT-3.5 before and after fine-tuning for conversational dialogue 3. For our prompts, we sample 100 instructions from AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023). We say that the model output reflects the ANSWER task if it attempts to answer the question, and otherwise reflects the REFUSE task if it is a refusal or an answer to a different question 4.

This is in line with research in this field such as Zou et al. (2023) and Wei et al.

For example, fine-tuning took the English ANSWER frequency from 92% to 3% while it took the Malayalam frequency from 71% to 65%. Therefore, we claim that conjugate prompting can partially recover the capability of harmful instruction following.

The general phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting where training on new tasks degrades performance on old tasks has been widely reported and studied (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Kemker et al., 2017). There have been many attempts to address this through continual learning via regularization or data replay (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Parisi et al., 2019; Peng & Risteski, 2022). We focus on leveraging extra problem structure in the LLM setting to devise our prompting strategy. Multi-task learning and meta-learning. Learning to solve multiple tasks falls under the umbrella of meta-learning (Finn et al., 2017; Kirsch & Schmidhuber, 2022; Andrychowicz et al., 2016) and multi-task learning (Evgeniou & Pontil, 2004; Radford et al., 2019).

Conjugate prompting also warns that restricting access to safety fine-tuned models is not secure. More than immediate utility, we hope our analysis brings us closer to principled adaptation of pretrained models. Our inference hypothesis opens up interesting questions in terms of whether transformers explicitly execute task inference through sub-networks that we could manipulate directly. Finally, better fine-tuning methods accompanied by a principled understanding could open up robust methods to guide task inference and leverage transformer capabilities for deployment.\nLimitations. We acknowledge that the controlled nature of our hypothesis test comes at the cost of evaluating on more common benchmarks. Language translation is not a perfect transformation due to third-party services, low-resource languages, and language contextual knowledge. Conjugate prompting also requires domain knowledge of tasks in the training distribution and application. There is scope for a larger evaluation testing relationships involving data, model size, and tasks."

We find that conjugate prompting consistently helps. Similar to our other experiments, it helps the most at low exemplar counts and more when the prior is already more biased to fine-tuning tasks. The benefits of conjugate prompting seem similar across scale, presumably since fine-tuning takes base models to similar functions."

If we refer to LREASON as the capability that solves a natural language reasoning task while LCODE is the capability that interprets the prompt as code, we can idealize the model\u2019s completion as\nL(prompt) = g\u03b8(prompt)LCODE(prompt) + (1\u2212 g\u03b8(prompt))LREASON(prompt)\nWe suspect that fine-tuning on code, even if it may improve general reasoning capabilities, will shift task inference and worsen performance on benchmarks such as natural language reasoning. We use conjugate prompting to test whether the capability has degraded or whether task inference has changed.\nConjugate prompting for Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference. To answer our question, we use the XNLI benchmark (Conneau et al., 2018), a multi-lingual version of the MNLI task (Williams et al., 2018) from GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) that tests understanding of sentence entailment. For evaluation, we ask a model to generate a response and assess whether it gave the correct answer 5. For our models, we test LLaMa-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) and Code LLaMa (Rozie\u0300re et al., 2023), which correspond to LLMs before and after fine-tuning on code. Code LLaMa reports that this training is primarily on English prompts. We present our results in Table 4. First, we observe that there is catastrophic forgetting in English, with Code LLaMa performing 8.36% worse than LLaMa-2 on this task. Second, we see that for the language French, Spanish, and German6, the accuracy changed by less than 2% in magnitude. In fact, the accuracy of Code LLaMa on Spanish and French XNLI slightly increases after fine-tuning, which we suspect could come from increased reasoning capabilities from code training (Fu & Khot, 2022; Ma et al., 2023) with conjugate prompting properly controlling task inference. We note that for this reasoning task, it is preferable to prompt the fine-tuned model in Spanish instead of English, demonstrating the utility of conjugate prompting.\n5We use the exact MLNI prompt template from lm-evaluation-harness (Gao et al., 2021a) 6which constitute all languages that XNLI supports, with a Latin alphabet, that are in LLaMa pretraining\nE IN-CONTEXT LEARNING VS INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT DETAILS"

    "abstractText": "While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, they pose potential safety concerns, such as the \u201cjailbreak\u201d problem, wherein malicious instructions can manipulate LLMs to exhibit undesirable behavior. Although several preventive measures have been developed to mitigate the potential risks associated with LLMs, they have primarily focused on English. In this study, we reveal the presence of multilingual jailbreak challenges within LLMs and consider two potential risky scenarios: unintentional and intentional. The unintentional scenario involves users querying LLMs using non-English prompts and inadvertently bypassing the safety mechanisms, while the intentional scenario concerns malicious users combining malicious instructions with multilingual prompts to deliberately attack LLMs. The experimental results reveal that in the unintentional scenario, the rate of unsafe content increases as the availability of languages decreases. Specifically, low-resource languages exhibit about three times the likelihood of encountering harmful content compared to high-resource languages, with both ChatGPT and GPT-4. In the intentional scenario, multilingual prompts can exacerbate the negative impact of malicious instructions, with astonishingly high rates of unsafe output: 80.92% for ChatGPT and 40.71% for GPT-4. To handle such a challenge in the multilingual context, we propose a novel SELF-DEFENSE framework that automatically generates multilingual training data for safety fine-tuning. Experimental results show that ChatGPT fine-tuned with such data can achieve a substantial reduction in unsafe content generation.

            "text": "Significant advancements have been made in the area of large language models (LLMs), as demonstrated by notable models such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023b), Claude (Anthropic, 2023), and Llama (Touvron et al., 2023). These models have shown remarkable progress in generalizing across various language processing tasks (Jiao et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b; Chang et al., 2023), and have thus been widely applied across diverse domains (Singhal et al., 2022; Choi et al., 2023; Rezayi et al., 2023). Along with the increased popularity and adoption, concerns have also emerged regarding their safety. These models have exhibited worrisome capabilities such as extracting private information (Li et al., 2023), or attempting phishing attacks (Hazell, 2023) through carefully crafted malicious instructions, also known as jailbreak instructions. Such malicious instructions intend to bypass LLMs\u2019 safety mechanisms, which can lead to undesirable and potentially harmful behaviors (Liu et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023).\n\u2217Yue Deng is under the Joint PhD Program between DAMO Academy and Nanyang Technological University.\n\u2020Wenxuan Zhang is the corresponding author.\nTo mitigate the potential risks, several prevention measures have been developed, including redteaming (Ganguli et al., 2022; Perez et al., 2022), content filtering (Hartvigsen et al., 2022; Welbl et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022). However, most of these existing studies on safety training have primarily focused on English, raising concerns about safety in multilingual contexts. Considering that LLMs often exhibit strong multilingual capabilities (Bang et al., 2023; Lai et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a) thanks to the pre-training on massive multilingual corpora and are widely used globally, the potential risk to global users cannot be overstated. In other words, the multilingual ability is obtained during the pre-training stage while not appropriately regulated in the later safety finetuning stage. As illustrated in Figure 1, the absence of adequate safety consideration in languages other than English can potentially pose safety risks for non-English speakers.\nTo study this issue, we begin with a preliminary experiment to test harmful queries for LLMs covering 30 languages, ranging from high-resource to low-resource. The preliminary results reveal a correlation between decreased language resources and an increased rate of unsafe outputs, indicating potential risks for low-resource language speakers. Moreover, this finding highlights the potential for using the language itself as a means of jailbreaking LLMs, i.e., querying LLMs in low-resource languages to generate unsafe content. Building upon these results, we propose a novel perspective for examining this topic, categorizing the scenarios into two types: unintentional and intentional. The unintentional scenario pertains to non-English users querying LLMs and inadvertently bypassing the safety mechanisms, thereby exposing themselves to unsafe content. On the other hand, the intentional scenario involves malicious users deliberately combining malicious instructions with multilingual prompts to launch targeted attacks against LLMs.\nConsidering these two scenarios, we carefully gather English harmful queries and manually translate them by native speakers into 9 non-English languages, ranging from high-resource to low-resource. This leads us to the creation of the first multilingual jailbreak dataset called MultiJail. The prompts in this dataset can directly serve for the unintentional scenario, while we also simulate an intentional scenario by combining the prompts with an English malicious instruction. Subsequently, we assess both scenarios using our dataset on two cutting-edge safety-tuned models: ChatGPT and GPT-4. Our evaluation reveals the effectiveness of attacks utilizing multilingual languages in both scenarios. Specifically, in the unintentional scenario, low-resource languages demonstrated a threefold higher likelihood of encountering harmful model generations compared to high-resource languages. In the intentional scenario, ChatGPT exhibits a surprisingly high unsafe rate of 80.92%, whereas GPT-4 also reaches a rate of 40.71%. The situation becomes even more worrisome when considering multilingual adaptive attacks, with ChatGPT showing an alarming rate of nearly 100% unsafe content, while GPT-4 demonstrates a 79.05% unsafe rate.\nTo address the multilingual jailbreak challenges in LLMs, we introduce SELF-DEFENCE, a novel framework inspired by SELF-INSTRUCT (Wang et al., 2023). SELF-DEFENCE directly utilizes the LLM to generate multilingual safety training data, which is then used for fine-tuning the LLM. Therefore, the multilingual jailbreak challenge can be alleviated without any human intervention, which is especially costly for multilingual data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach in enhancing LLMs\u2019 multilingual safety capabilities: the unsafe rate of ChatGPT after SELF-DEFENSE training obtained a remarkable reduction of 6.24% in the unintentional scenario and an impressive decrease of 20.92% in the intentional scenario. Furthermore, our analysis has identified the trade-off between safety and usefulness that exists in safety training.\nIn summary, our main contributions are as follows: (1) We identify the presence of multilingual jailbreak challenges within LLMs and propose to study them under two potential scenarios: unintentional and intentional. (2) We introduce the first manually-created multilingual jailbreak dataset, MultiJail, and demonstrate the effectiveness of multilingualism as a jailbreak method in both scenarios through extensive experiments. (3) We propose a novel framework called SELF-DEFENCE to effectively alleviate the multilingual jailbreak challenge in LLMs without any human annotation."

            "text": "Dataset & Language We construct a curated dataset by gathering 15 harmful English prompts from the GPT-4 report (OpenAI, 2023b). These intentionally crafted samples are designed to bypass safety mechanisms and have the potential to trigger the generation of harmful content in LLMs. We evaluate a diverse set of languages, from widely spoken to lesser-known ones. Following Lai et al. (2023), we determine the resource levels for each language by utilizing the data ratio from the CommonCrawl corpus1, which is the primary dataset for most LLMs\u2019 pre-training. Specifically, a language is categorized as high-resource if its data ratio exceeds 1% (HRL, > 1%), medium-resource if it falls between 0.1% and 1% (MRL, > 0.1%), and low-resource if it is below 0.1% (LRL, < 0.1%). We choose 10 languages for each category, resulting in a total of 30 languages (see Appendix A.1 for details). This selection ensures coverage of a wide range of linguistic characteristics and resource availability. To obtain examples in these languages, we utilize Google Translate2 to convert the English data from the curated dataset to these languages, resulting in a total of 450 examples.\nModel & Evaluation We evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo-0613) for its significant impact and strong multilingual capabilities, using a temperature of 0 for consistency. Similar to Wei et al. (2023), outputs are classified as safe, unsafe, or invalid. safe responses are free of harmful content or decline to answer unsafe questions, while unsafe responses contain harmful content or directly address unsafe queries. invalid responses are unrelated or unnatural, used when LLMs provide irrelevant or incoherent answers for non-English queries. Our main focus is identifying and reporting the unsafe rate, and the percentage of unsafe responses among all generated by the target LLMs. We use Google Translate to translate the output to English and then have human evaluators label the translated results. While translation may introduce noise, we found that evaluating safety is a relatively straightforward task that does not require high-quality translation. Furthermore, following Yuan et al. (2023) and Bhardwaj & Poria (2023), we leverage the robust evaluation capabilities of GPT-4 for automated model evaluation. By integrating evaluation prompts, we convert GPT-4 into a safety evaluator. This involves presenting translated English outputs alongside prompts to classify responses as unsafe, safe, or invalid. See details in Appendix A.2."

            "text": "Figure 2 presents the preliminary results on the curated dataset. While LLMs can effectively defend against harmful queries in high-resource languages, their performance declines with decreasing resource availability. In such cases, they tend to generate unsafe responses to harmful queries, raising the average unsafe rate from about 11% to 55% in the curated dataset. These findings show the potential of multilingualism as a jailbreak method.\n1http://commoncrawl.org 2https://translate.google.com\nBuilding upon this discovery, we further consider two risk scenarios: (1) unintentional: This highlights the heightened risk faced by speakers of low-resource languages regarding exposure to harmful content. Due to the limitations imposed by resource availability, LLMs may struggle to effectively filter or prevent the generation of unsafe responses. This poses a significant challenge for individuals relying on these models, as they may unknowingly encounter harmful or biased information. (2) intentional: Malicious actors may take advantage of the vulnerabilities in these models to intentionally map their harmful prompts into low-resource languages, through translation services such as Google Translate. Additionally, they may even combine these prompts with malicious instructions obtained from online sources, thereby amplifying the potential for further attacks.\nFurthermore, Figure 2 illustrates the substantial correlation between human annotators and the GPT4 evaluator, underscored by a Cohen\u2019s kappa score of 0.86, which signifies a high degree of alignment. Given the costly and subjective nature of human evaluation, we chose to utilize GPT-4 in our subsequent experiment as a viable approach for evaluating the safety of LLMs\u2019 outputs."

Given our emphasis on jailbreak challenges, we have purposely sampled from harmful examples by considering their task description harmlessness score and tags attributes, while excluding general question and answering pairs. As the Anthropic dataset consists of dialogue scripts, we extract the first sentence from each script to create our dataset queries. Subsequently, we combine the previously curated dataset with the sampled Anthropic dataset, resulting in a final dataset containing a total of 315 examples. This integration broadens the evaluation\u2019s scope and diversity, facilitating a more comprehensive analysis. Details on safety issues covered in this newly created dataset are presented in Appendix A.3.\nBased on the preliminary study discussed in Section 2, we select three languages from each category for further analysis: High-resource: Chinese (zh), Italian (it), Vietnamese (vi); Medium-resource: Arabic (ar), Korean (ko), Thai (th); Low-resource: Bengali (bn), Swahili (sw), Javanese (jv).\nTo prevent noisy translation that may cause inaccurate evaluation, we incorporate native speakers for human translation. All translators are instructed to translate the English dataset into the target language while preserving the original meaning. To ensure the quality of these human translations, we randomly select a subset of translations and have a separate group of native speakers verify their quality. We aim for a pass rate of over 97% to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the translations. Finally, we have obtained a multilingual jailbreak dataset named MultiJail. It comprises a total of 3150 samples, with 315 samples in English and parallel samples in nine other diverse non-English languages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multilingual jailbreak dataset available.\nModel & Evaluation We employ two multilingual models, namely ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo-0613) and GPT-4 (GPT-4-0613), for our detailed evaluation. These models stand out due to their impressive multilingual power, widespread usage, and high level of safety. To ensure consistent responses, we set the temperature to 0 and maintain default settings for other hyperparameters. For further verification, we evaluate decoding with nucleus sampling in\nAppendix A.6 and find that the observations are consistent. As described in Section 2, we utilize Google Translate and GPT-4 as the evaluators to assess the translated English output for unsafe, safe, and invalid classifications with the unsafe rate as our metric.\nSetting As discussed in Section 2, this study considers two risk scenarios: unintentional and intentional. To simulate the unintentional scenario, we directly use the human-translated harmful prompts in MultiJail as queries for LLMs. For the intentional scenario, we select a powerful malicious instruction called AIM3 from jailbreakchat.com4, a platform for sharing malicious instructions. The selection attempts to mimic a malicious user\u2019s behavior who, in a real-life scenario, would likely search the internet to find the most effective malicious instructions for intentional malicious purposes. We take the English version of AIM and concatenate it with the translated harmful prompts to form the final query of the LLMs. This setup allows us to simulate a scenario where a malicious user searches for an English malicious instruction and combines it with a non-English harmful prompt, intending to obtain unsafe content from the LLMs."

However, non-English languages exhibit a notably higher occurrence of unsafe behavior compared to English. For ChatGPT, the average unsafe rate increases to 10.19%. Even though GPT-4 is claimed to be a much safer model (Chen et al., 2023), it still has an average unsafe rate of 5.96%. These findings show the challenge posed by insufficient consideration of safety issues regarding non-English languages.\nUnsafe rate increases with decreasing language availability When examining the language categories, we notice a consistent pattern similar to our preliminary experiments, where the presence of unsafe content increases as language availability decreases. In the case of ChatGPT, the rate of encountering unsafe content rises significantly from 4.34% to 14.92%, while for GPT-4, it increases from 3.60% to 10.16%. This finding suggests that individuals who speak low-resource languages are approximately three times more likely to unintentionally come across harmful content. For instance, in Bengali, a language with limited internet resources but an astounding 285 million native speakers5, the rates of encountering unsafe content are alarmingly high, reaching 28.25% for ChatGPT and 12.7% for GPT-4. These statistics indicate that even a single low-resource language can pose significant challenges in terms of encountering unsafe content.\n3AIM incorporates both roleplay and explicit instructions to bypass safety mechanisms. It was selected due to its highest number of \u201cVotes\u201d on jailbreakchat.com as of September 1, 2023. Detailed prompt is given in Appendix A.4\n4https://www.jailbreakchat.com/ 5https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengalis\nMultilingual adaptive attack poses greater threat Inspired by Wei et al. (2023), we explore a multilingual adaptive attack strategy where an adaptive adversary exploits translation as a jailbreak method. This adversary can iterate through a candidate pool of languages to execute an attack. Our evaluation considers the attack successful if any of the attempted languages yield unsafe content. The experimental results, as shown in Table 2, demonstrate that the multilingual attack proves to be an effective jailbreak method, with ChatGPT achieving a 44.76% unsafe rate and GPT-4 achieving a 27.30% unsafe rate. Even when considering\nonly three low-resource languages, there exists a substantial likelihood of successfully attacking ChatGPT, potentially up to one-third. This probability remains relatively high, around one-fourth, even with the introduction of more advanced GPT-4. The widespread availability and accessibility of translation services in today\u2019s world make this jailbreak method simple and affordable. Consequently, it poses a significant and tangible threat to the security and safety of AI-powered systems."

Similarly, GPT-4\u2019s unsafe rate increases from 0.95% to 28.25% for English prompts. Moreover, when non-English prompts are combined with malicious instructions, the unsafe rates escalate even further. In the case of ChatGPT, the unsafe rate reaches an astonishing 80.92%, while GPT-4 reaches 40.71%. The presence of non-English prompts further complicates the already challenging task, leading to an 8.86% increase for ChatGPT and a notable 12.46% increase for GPT-4 when compared to using only English prompts. The situation becomes even more concerning when considering multilingual adaptive attacks, as shown in Table 2. The findings presented in the table reveal alarming results. ChatGPT exhibits an extremely high unsafe rate, nearly reaching 100%. Even GPT-4, which demonstrates more advanced safety capabilities, still shows significant vulnerability at 79.05%. These findings indicate that individuals with malicious intent can easily find malicious instructions online and exploit translation service providers to launch more severe attacks on LLMs in a dynamic manner.\nLLMs show relative stability despite language availability in intentional scenario Upon closer examination of the impact of language categories on unsafe rates in Table 1, both LLMs display relative stability across low-resource to high-resource languages, compared to the clear increasing trend with decreasing language availability in the unintentional scenario. Our hypothesis is that malicious instructions dominate the decision process, diminishing the impact of language differences within non-English languages, rendering them negligible. It shows that the introduction of malicious instructions alters the default behavior of LLMs, revealing a more nuanced relationship between language availability, instructions, and LLM behavior."

Interestingly, we find that low-resource languages exhibit the most substantial decrease, followed by medium-resource languages, while high-resource languages show the least decrease. We hypothesize that the limited multilingual capabilities of LLMs restrict their complete understanding of the malicious instruction, inadvertently preventing the generation of unsafe content.\nOpen-source LLMs We also evaluate three open-source LLMs: Llama2-chat6 (Touvron et al., 2023), Vicuna7 (Chiang et al., 2023), and SeaLLM-v28 (Nguyen et al., 2023). Detailed results are in Appendix A.7. While Llama2-chat has the lowest unsafe rate, it has significantly more invalid responses. Its preference for English responses also limits usability for non-English speakers. Vicuna, lacking safety tuning, has a remarkably high 57.17% unsafe rate in English, and its disorganized training data leads to unpredictable outcomes. Furthermore, SeaLLM-v2 achieves significant improvements in Southeast Asian languages, even surpassing ChatGPT and GPT-4, underscoring the effectiveness of language-specific safety tuning.

Next, we employ these seed examples to augment the dataset using the LLM. By leveraging the capabilities of the LLM, we can generate additional examples and expand the dataset. We then utilize the LLM\u2019s robust multilingual ability and translate the instruction pairs into target languages, which enables us to create a diverse corpus of instructions in multiple languages. Finally, we merge the language-specific corpora generated in the previous steps to create the final training data for fine-tuning. It is important to note that all the data used in these stages are generated solely by the LLM, without any human annotation, except for the limited number of seed examples.\nOverall, the incorporation of seed examples, along with the augmentation stage, contributes to the formation of a comprehensive and diverse training set. On the other hand, the translation process enables the transfer of knowledge and safety guidelines across multiple languages, thereby improving the safety alignment in a multilingual context. Moreover, the SELF-DEFENCE framework offers a high degree of flexibility, allowing for the generation of safety content on specific topics or adapting to new languages via fine-grained instruction design.

Additionally, intentional scenarios see a drop from 80.92% to 60.00%, highlighting SELFDEFENCE\u2019s impact in defending against multilingual malicious attacks.\nMoreover, we aim to explore SELF-DEFENCE\u2019s impact on LLM\u2019s overall capabilities. To assess this, we define two metrics: safety and usefulness. Safety measures the model\u2019s ability to generate safe content, while usefulness assesses how well the LLM\u2019s output meets user requirements. Higher values for both metrics indicate better performance. To conduct our evaluation, we sample 30 examples in English and 9 non-English languages from the annotated MultiJail dataset, totaling 270 examples. We calculate the average safe rate for both unintentional and intentional scenarios as a safety metric. For the assessment of usefulness, we sample 30 examples in English and each language overlapping with MultiJail from XNLI (Conneau et al., 2018) and X-CSQA (Lin et al., 2021), resulting in 180 examples for both datasets (See detailed language selection in Appendix A.10.).\n9https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning\nThese two datasets are commonly utilized for evaluating the general capabilities of multilingual models.

The results are presented in Figure 6. As the amount of safety training data increases, the model becomes significantly safer. However, there is a decrease in its general capability. One possible reason is that the responses generated by SELF-DEFENCE for unsafe queries are not sufficiently comprehensive. Most of the responses simply reject answering the question and provide a brief explanation of why it is unsafe. To achieve optimal performance in both aspects, it\nmay be necessary to offer more complex responses that provide detailed explanations of why the request is unsafe and convincingly discourage the user from pursuing such requests.

To assess LLMs\u2019 ability to generate harmful content, red teaming is employed, which involves human teams (Ganguli et al., 2022) or other LLMs (Perez et al., 2022) to identify and measure the generation of undesirable and harmful content. This process helps researchers and developers understand the potential vulnerabilities and biases of LLMs, enabling them to make necessary improvements. To prevent the production of harmful content, two approaches are commonly used. One approach involves fine-tuning LLMs to detect and filter out undesirable content after generation (Hartvigsen et al., 2022; Markov et al., 2023). Alternatively, efforts have been made to directly adapt LLM behavior to produce safer outputs and avoid generating unsafe content. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), originally proposed for improving agent-based reinforcement learning (Christiano et al., 2017), has shown promise in correcting LLM behavior (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022).\nJailbreak While safety training can significantly reduce the generation of unsafe content, LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial inputs that trigger undesired behavior, commonly referred to as \u201cjailbreak\u201d (Liu et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023). Unlike traditional adversarial attacks primarily focusing on causing misclassification by manipulating features (Chakraborty et al., 2021), jailbreak attacks specifically aim to generate unsafe content through input construction. Various approaches have been proposed to exploit these vulnerabilities. For example, Li et al. (2023) introduces a multistep jailbreak prompt to extract personally identifiable information from LLMs. Efforts have also been made to automate jailbreak attacks across LLMs, as explored in Deng et al. (2023) and Zou et al. (2023). More recently, Wei et al. (2023) hypothesizes two failure modes of safety alignment: competing objectives and mismatched generalization. Competing objectives occur when a model\u2019s abilities conflict with its safety objectives, while mismatched generalization happens when safety training cannot effectively apply to a domain where the model\u2019s capabilities are present."

            "text": "In this paper, we investigate the presence of multilingual jailbreak challenges in LLMs and consider two risky scenarios: unintentional and intentional. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that multilingual languages can serve as a potential jailbreak method in both scenarios, posing significant threats. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel framework called SELF-DEFENCE, which has proven to be highly effective in enhancing the multilingual safety capabilities of LLMs."

            "text": "Our research investigates the safety challenges of LLMs in multilingual settings. We are aware of the potential misuse of our findings and emphasize that our research is solely for academic purposes and ethical use. Misuse or harm resulting from the information in this paper is strongly discouraged. To address the identified risks and vulnerabilities, we commit to open-sourcing the data used in our study. This openness aims to facilitate vulnerability identification, encourage discussions, and foster collaborative efforts to enhance LLM safety in multilingual contexts. Furthermore, we have developed the SELF-DEFENCE framework to address multilingual jailbreak challenges in LLMs. This framework automatically generates multilingual safety training data to mitigate risks associated with unintentional and intentional jailbreak scenarios. Overall, our work not only highlights multilingual jailbreak challenges in LLMs but also paves the way for future research, collaboration, and innovation to enhance their safety."

            "text": "We extend our evaluations in unintentional scenarios to three open-source LLMs: Llama2-chat10 (Touvron et al., 2023), Vicuna11 (Chiang et al., 2023), and SeaLLM-v212 (Nguyen et al., 2023). Specifically, SeaLLM-v2 stands out as a multilingual LLM tailored for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages, sharing language coverage with MultiJail in th, vi, and jv. See Table 6 for detailed results.\nWhen comparing to ChatGPT and GPT-4 in Table 1, it is obvious that all models frequently produce invalid outputs due to their limited multilingual capabilities. Although Llama2-chat demonstrates the lowest average unsafe rate, it is challenging to determine whether this lower rate stems from genuinely safe content or simply generates more invalid responses. Additionally, while Llama2-chat can comprehend non-English inputs, its tendency to mostly respond in English may limit its practicality\n10https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf 11https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5 12https://huggingface.co/SeaLLMs/SeaLLM-7B-v2\nin real-world scenarios, especially for non-English-speaking users. Vicuna has not undergone specific safety tuning, leading to a significantly high unsafe rate, even in English, where the unsafe rate stands at a staggering 57.17%. Furthermore, it is trained on conversations from users of ChatGPT and GPT-4, faces challenges due to the disorganized language distribution in its training data, resulting in unpredictable outcomes. SeaLLM-v2, after pre-training and supervised fine-tuning across the three overlapping SEA languages, exhibits significantly lower unsafe and invalid rates in these languages, surpassing even ChatGPT and GPT-4. This proves that incorporating more language into safety tuning could greatly improve LLM\u2019s understanding of each language, thereby enabling it to provide safer responses more effectively. However, for other languages, the rates remain high, suggesting that extending multilingual and safety capabilities to out-of-domain languages remains challenging, especially considering the high cost of multilingual data."

Different languages show differing safety performance levels depending on the tag. For example, querying about weapons in Bengali to ChatGPT has a notably higher unsafe rate than other languages. Similarly, interacting with ChatGPT in Thai about substance abuse results in a significantly higher unsafe rate compared to other languages. These observations highlight potential vulnerabilities and biases in each language. Such findings stress the need for continuous improvements and targeted refinement in the model\u2019s safety capabilities across languages."

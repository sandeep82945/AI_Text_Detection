    "abstractText": "The ability to derive underlying principles from a handful of observations and then generalize to novel situations\u2014known as inductive reasoning\u2014is central to human intelligence. Prior work suggests that language models (LMs) often fall short on inductive reasoning, despite achieving impressive success on research benchmarks. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the inductive reasoning capabilities of LMs through iterative hypothesis refinement, a technique that more closely mirrors the human inductive process than standard input-output prompting. Iterative hypothesis refinement employs a three-step process: proposing, selecting, and refining hypotheses in the form of textual rules. By examining the intermediate rules, we observe that LMs are phenomenal hypothesis proposers (i.e., generating candidate rules), and when coupled with a (task-specific) symbolic interpreter that is able to systematically filter the proposed set of rules, this hybrid approach achieves strong results across inductive reasoning benchmarks that require inducing causal relations, language-like instructions, and symbolic concepts. However, they also behave as puzzling inductive reasoners, showing notable performance gaps in rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules) and rule application (i.e., applying proposed rules to instances), suggesting that LMs are proposing hypotheses without being able to actually apply the rules. Through empirical and human analyses, we further reveal several discrepancies between the inductive reasoning processes of LMs and humans, shedding light on both the potentials and limitations of using LMs in inductive reasoning tasks.",

            "text": "Inductive reasoning, i.e., the ability to identify common patterns and form high-level abstractions from limited observations, is considered key to human intelligence (Lake et al., 2017; Chollet, 2019). For instance, humans can quickly identify the generalizable list operation rule \u201cselecting the first item\u201d based on only a few observations (Figure 1, top). Although the precise cognitive mechanisms behind inductive reasoning remain unknown, one compelling hypothesis in cognitive science posits that humans approach this challenge through an iterative process that involves proposing hypotheses, testing them against observations, and refining them accordingly (Heit, 2000; Fra\u0308nken et al., 2022). Returning to the above example, while the hypothesis \u201cselecting the smallest item\u201d may seem plausible based on the first two examples, applying this rule to the final example reveals the need for refinement, ultimately favoring \u201cselecting the first item\u201d as a more accurate hypothesis.\nWith the increasing power of state-of-the-art LMs (OpenAI, 2023; Anthropic, 2023), there is growing interest in exploring these models\u2019 reasoning capabilities vis-a\u0300-vis human inductive reasoning. How are their performances and underlying mechanisms similar to (and contrasted with) those of humans? This work investigates LMs\u2019 inductive reasoning capabilities through the lens of iterative hypothesis refinement: hypotheses generation, selection, and refinement. Specifically, we use an LM to propose a set of free-form or constrained hypotheses based on observations. The proposed hypotheses are then verified against observations via off-the-shelf symbolic interpreters1, e.g., gram-\n1If the hypothesis is in free-form natural language, we additionally ask an LM to translate it into a specific format, e.g., code, that is interpretable by the symbolic interpreter. See Appendix D for examples.\nmar parsers or code interpreters, which can determine if an hypothesis applies to specific instances. The hypothesis that covers most number of observations is then selected to be further refined by the LM. This process is repeated to induce the final hypothesis.\nResults across four distinct tasks, including inducing causal relations (Zhang et al., 2021), languagelike compositional instructions (Lake et al., 2019), symbolic operations (Rule, 2020), and visual concepts (Kim et al., 2022b), show that this iterative hypothesis refinement process significantly improves upon standard input-output (IO) prompting. We find that LMs are particularly good at generating candidate rules, and when coupled with a symbolic interpreter that can provide accurate feedback with which to refine hypotheses, this hybrid induction approach is effective.\nHowever, a closer inspection of the refinement pipeline reveals a more nuanced view of the putative inductive reasoning process of LMs. Despite being able to generate plausible candidate rules, LMs display a range of puzzling counterintuitive behaviors. For one, while we might expect humans be able to apply the rules they propose, we find that LMs are often unable to correctly applying their own proposed rules (\u00a74.1). Moreover, while humans can make robust inductions by abstracting away from small perturbations present in examples (e.g., different representational forms of examples), we observe LMs to be highly brittle in the face of even minor perturbations (\u00a74.2). Finally, a human study reveals that rules induced by LMs generally have different content and form compared to rules generated by humans. LMs often provide verbose descriptions of patterns but fail to leverage pragmatic communication strategies commonly seen in human induction (\u00a74.3).\nOur study unveils the paradoxical inductive capabilities of LMs: they are simultaneously phenomenal hypothesis proposers and puzzling inductive reasoners. Our paper connects to classical approaches for concept induction (Tenenbaum et al., 2011; Ellis et al., 2023, i.a.), latent language optimization (Andreas et al., 2018; Mu et al., 2020, i.a.), and instruction induction (Honovich et al., 2023). While similar in spirit to recent work on exploring inductive reasoning with LMs (Wang et al., 2023a), our work offers a nuanced exploration of both the potentials and limitations of LMs."

            "text": "We consider the rule induction problem of inferring a function f : X \u2192 Y that maps an input x \u2208 X to an output y \u2208 Y . The rule, f , can take various forms, such as mathematical operations, grammar, and even natural language descriptions (see Appendix D for examples). For each task \u03c4 , we have a set of examples D\u03c4 consisting of input-output pairs (x, y). We further divide D\u03c4 into seen examples, Ds\u03c4 , and unseen examples, Du\u03c4 . The goal is to induce the f that best describes D\u03c4 using only Ds\u03c4 . A good rule thus requires a balance between precision and coverage, i.e., it should be simultaneously expressive enough to capture Ds\u03c4 and generalizable to Du\u03c4 .\nWe assess an LM\u2019s ability to induce rules through prompting. Let h \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 be a rule generated by an LM, where \u03a3 is the LM\u2019s vocabulary. Since we cannot directly apply h to x (h is just a piece of text), we make use of an interpreter I\u03c4 : \u03a3\u2217 \u2192 F for each task \u03c4 where F is the space of all functions from X to Y (i.e., f \u2208 F). That is, the interpreter I\u03c4 \u201ccompiles\u201d h into a function that can be applied to x.2 The quality of rules is evaluated based on their performance on unseen examples. Given an induced rule h and n unseen examples Du\u03c4 = {(x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn)}, we derive outputs y\u2032i by applying I\u03c4 (h) to input xi,\ny\u2032i = I\u03c4 (h)(xi). (1)\nAlthough it is ideal to have interpreters that can correctly apply h, such perfect interpreters might not always be available. Importantly, interpreters have no access to Ds\u03c4 , and thus, the rule must contain sufficient information for interpreters to achieve strong performance when applying the rule.\nWe evaluate the quality of a rule h using accuracy. More formally, for a task \u03c4 containing a set of unseen examples Du\u03c4 , we first define the accuracy for this particular task as\na\u03c4 = 1 |Du\u03c4 | \u2211\n(x,y)\u2208Du\u03c4\n1 [ I\u03c4 (h)(x) = y ] . (2)\nLet T denotes the set of all tasks within a dataset. We define raw accuracy c and task accuracy ct as\nc = 1 |T | \u2211 \u03c4\u2208T a\u03c4 ct = 1 |T | \u2211 \u03c4\u2208T 1 [ a\u03c4 = 1 ] . (3)\nWhile raw accuracy is the standard metric used in prior work, task accuracy could better estimate an LM\u2019s induction capability: a model should ideally consistently solve examples within a task. We use GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613; OpenAI, 2023) for all experiments and analyses. We include additional results of other models, including GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613), Claude-2 (Anthropic, 2023), and LLaMA2-70B (Touvron et al., 2023) in Appendix B."

            "text": "We consider an iterative approach to induce rules from LMs. We use LMs to propose a set of rules (i.e., hypotheses). We then select the best rule based on scores calculated using the interpreter function. We provide feedback to LMs for further refinement. See Figure 1 for an overview.\nSpecifically, given k exemplars Ds\u03c4 = {(x1, y1), ..., (xk, yk)}, at iteration t, we sample N hypotheses of rules, Ht = {ht1, ..., htN}, from a prompted LM,\nht \u223c PLM ( \u00b7 |dt\u22121, x1, y1, ..., xk, yk), (4)\nwhere dt\u22121 is the feedback from previous iterations and which is set to be an empty string at the initial iteration. Each hypothesis is re-ranked based on a scoring function s(h,Ds\u03c4 ). We use accuracy over seen examples as the scoring function,\ns(h,Ds\u03c4 ) = 1 |Ds\u03c4 | \u2211\n(x,y)\u2208Ds\u03c4\n1 [ I\u03c4 (h)(x) = y ] .

(6)\nWe then obtain feedback dt by passing the best hypothesis to a template-based feedback generator. The feedback dt is a concatenation of exemplars with incorrect predictions, formatted as input, expected output, and tentative output. The iteration stops if the interpreter produces correct outputs for all exemplars using the current hypothesis or if the maximum iteration T is reached. In all experiments, we consider a combination of maximum number of iterations T \u2208 {1, 3} and number of hypotheses per iteration N \u2208 {1, 5}. We use greedy decoding when generating a single hypothesis and set the temperature to 0.7 when generating multiple hypotheses following Wang et al. (2023b).\n2For example, if h is the string representation of a Python function, I\u03c4 (h) can be the actual Python function. Note that the same rule h could be applied differently by different interpreters."

            "text": "The above framework requires three specifications: the rule function f , the representation (i.e., the format and content) of h, and the interpreter I . We evaluate on 4 datasets (where each dataset consists of multiple tasks) and formulate these specifications as follows (see examples in Figure 1). We show the full dataset details in Appendix A.\nACRE. The Abstract Causal REasoning (ACRE; Zhang et al., 2021) is a diagnostic dataset designed to evaluate causal induction ability. It requires identifying a set of \u201cBlicket\u201d objects that will trigger a special machine. We can view f as an indicator function s.t. f(x;B) = 1[B \u2229 x] where B is the set of Blickets and x is the presented objects. We constrain h to classify each object into one of three categories: a Blicket, not a Blicket, or undetermined. I ( h)(x) is thus a deterministic function that checks the intersections between current objects and predicted Blickets.\nMiniSCAN. Lake et al. (2019) developed a sequence-to-sequence task with only 14 training examples to measure few-shot concept learning ability. We refer to this as MiniSCAN following Nye et al. (2020).3 Similar to SCAN (Lake & Baroni, 2018), MiniSCAN requires translating an input command x to an output action sequence y. We consider f as a set of grammar rules that map the input symbols to the corresponding meaning representations. We use a quasi-synchronous context free grammar (Smith & Eisner, 2006) as our formalism for h and use a parser as our interpreter I(h).\nList Functions. The List Functions dataset (Rule, 2020) is designed to evaluate human and machine concept learning ability. It requires identifying a function that maps the input list to its corresponding output list. Here f is a primitive or compositional list operation. We represent h as natural language description and implement the interpreter I using a two-stage process. First, we ask an LM to translate the natural language hypothesis h into a Python program. Then we execute this program to produce the corresponding outputs for given inputs.4\nMiniARC. The Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC; Chollet, 2019) and its variants (Kim et al., 2022b; Acquaviva et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023b; Moskvichev et al., 2023) aim to evaluate visual abstract reasoning over broad concepts. The f here involves a transformation between input and output 2D grids, such as moving an object or swapping colors. We use natural language hypotheses h and similarly interpret the hypotheses using a Python interpreter. Given the extensive grid size of the original ARC tasks and the limited context length of LMs, we consider MiniARC (Kim et al., 2022b), a 5x5 compact version of the ARC.\n3 LMS ARE PHENOMENAL HYPOTHESIS PROPOSERS\nMain Results. We compare hypothesis refinement with standard input-output (IO) prompting, self-consistency prompting (SC; Wang et al., 2023b), and self-refine (SR; Madaan et al., 2023).5 SC samples multiple outputs and selects the most consistent one by taking a majority vote. SR uses the same LM as an interpreter and provides feedback to itself, and is a \u201cpure LM\u201d baseline that does not utilize a symbolic interpreter. The results are shown in Table 1 (see Appendix C for existing human performance). Iterative hypothesis refinement achieves the strongest performance on 3 out of 4 datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach. However, it lags behind the baselines on raw accuracy of MiniARC, potentially because some tasks in MiniARC are heavily dependent on pattern matching, for which IO prompting might be more effective (Mirchandani et al., 2023). Additionally, due to the limited visual understanding capabilities inherent in text-only models, the performance on MiniARC is still far from optimal for all methods, in comparison to other datasets.\nSimilar to prior work (Chen et al., 2023a; Olausson et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023, i.a.), sampling more hypotheses and using iterative refinement with external feedback significantly boost LM per-\n3This task is also sometimes referred to as \u201cColors\u201d (Akyurek & Andreas, 2021; Patel et al., 2022). 4Although this method might introduce potential errors due to mistranslations between natural language and code, in practice, we qualitatively examine the programs and find that LMs can often generate programs that faithfully represent the natural language hypotheses.\n5These cannot be directly compared with our method, as hypothesis refinement is augmented with symbolic interpreters. We include them as baselines as they are standard approaches used in existing studies.\nformance, leading to the best accuracy on the majority of datasets.6 It is important to emphasize that both iterative refinement and external feedback are essential. Simply sampling more predictions and taking a majority vote (as SC prompting), does not necessarily improve performance. This might due to the fact that increasing the temperature for sampling results in many incorrect predictions. In contrast, increasing the number of hypotheses performs better due to the hypotheses selection process. An iterative approach that uses the LM itself as an interpreter (i.e., SR) is also insufficient. We observe performance substantially degrades when replacing the symbolic interpreter with an LM, suggesting that the LM can excel as a hypothesis proposer but performs poorly as an interpreter.\nWe also observe a significant discrepancy between raw accuracy and task accuracy, especially for IO prompting and SC prompting. Since these evaluations directly predict output for each individual example, there is no guarantee that the LM is solving the task following the underlying rules. In fact, the mismatch between raw accuracy and task accuracy indicates some correct predictions might be generated without using the expected computation. In contrast, rule prompting (i.e., applying the LM-proposed rules) suffers less from this issue as it re-uses the same rule across all examples.\nOOD Generalization and Interpretability. In addition to strong performance, iterative hypothesis refinement also enables out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and improves interpretability of models. For OOD evaluations, we sample longer examples from the ground-truth programs for List Functions,7 and annotate examples with a larger grid for MiniARC. We evaluate performance on these OOD examples while fixing the seen examples. We show the results in Figure 2. We observe a significant performance drop for OOD examples when using IO prompting. However, the degradation is less severe for rule prompting except task accuracy on MiniARC, suggesting the LM likely solves the task using generalizable operations. While IO prompting still achieves better raw accuracy on MiniARC in OOD evaluations, the performance gap between it and rule prompting is reduced. Rule prompting also allows us to examine the intermediate operations, thus improving the interpretability of models. We show examples of LM-induced rules in Table 2 and Table 11.\n6We observe T=3, N=1 performs better than T=3, N=5 on MiniSCAN, potentially because the dataset is designed to evaluate compositional generalization, and thus high accuracy over seen examples does not necessarily translate to high accuracy on unseen examples. Since iterative refinement only uses accuracy over exemplars as the scoring function, it might overfit to exemplars and select hypotheses that are less generalizable.\n7Although we can theoretically sample longer sequences for MiniSCAN, we did not consider that setup, as the limited exemplars could lead to underspecification and result in multiple plausible parses due to ambiguity.\n4 LMS ARE PUZZLING INDUCTIVE REASONERS\nDespite the strong performance of iterative refinement on inductive reasoning, we identify several puzzling behaviors of LMs that seems to differ from human intuition (Fukushima, 1986; Heit, 2000)."

Here we examine the extent to which LMs \u201cunderstand\u201d the rules they propose. Specifically, given the rules induced from previous experiments, we test whether LMs can apply these rules to novel examples. We should expect comparable performance if LMs understand their own proposed rules. Results are shown in Figure 3. We observe a consistent performance drop when using the LM interpreter as opposed to the symbolic interpreter. This issue is especially significant on datasets like MiniSCAN, where rule application involves complex and recursive operations.\nThis performance inconsistency between rule induction and rule application reveals a counterintuitive behavior of LMs on inductive reasoning. Intuitively, once humans have induced a rule, they can use this rule in novel scenarios. However, LMs struggle with applying the rule, even if the rule was derived from themselves. Note that prior work has provided evidence suggesting that LMs might fall short on solving symbolic tasks (Dziri et al., 2023), and we do not claim that we should expect using an LM as the interpreter perform as effectively as a symbolic interpreter. However, the gaps are often so large (e.g., task accuracy dropping from more than 80% to almost-zero in MiniSCAN) that they are still nonetheless strong indicators of LMs\u2019 puzzling behaviors.8 In particular, LMs are able to generate meaningful hypotheses and improve them iteratively, but simultaneously fail to understand their proposed rules. This observation can be loosely related to other inconsistencies observed between generation and recognition in existing LMs. For instance, while LMs can identify errors in their own generations (Agrawal et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b), they may also fail to validate a correct answer generated by themselves (Li et al., 2023)."

We also assume examples are presented in the format that close to LM\u2019s pre-training distribution. However, in practice, low-quality examples are ubiquitous. Humans can often reason robustly despite a certain level of noise, such as disregarding typos or a few erroneous examples (Fukushima, 1986; Heit, 2000). We now investigate if LMs can similarly make robust inductions. We use iterative hypothesis refinement with T = 3 and N = 5, which has the strongest performance in our main experiments. We include results using other models and configurations in Appendix B.2.\nNoisiness of Exemplars. We first study LMs\u2019 robustness to noisy examples. Specifically, we use List Functions and introduce noise into a certain percentage of exemplars by randomly replacing 1-2 elements with other numbers in the outputs. We perturb 12.5%, 25%, and 50% of the examples, out of a total of 8 exemplars. The results are shown in Figure 4a. We find the LM performs substantially worse even with a single noisy example, and its performance consistently decreases as the amount of\n8More advanced prompting techniques, such as SC prompting and zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, also do not bridge the gap (see Appendix B.2 for details).\nnoise increases. Although explicitly instructing the LM to take into account noisy examples (dashed line) mitigates this issue, the performance degradation remains significant (see Table 16 for the exact instructions). This brittleness raises another concerns about their otherwise promising performance.9\nFamiliarity of Exemplars. Next we study if LMs are robust to example representation. We examine this by varying the familiarity of exemplars, i.e., how well the examples are represented in the LMs\u2019 pre-training data. As rules represent higher-level abstraction, ideally we should expect LMs\u2019 performance to be independent of their specific instantiations (Newell, 1980). We use MiniSCAN dataset and re-generate new examples using the same grammar rules but with varied output vocabularies. We consider two variants: the first involves pseudowords as inputs with abstract English concepts as outputs (e.g., dax \u2192 RED), as the original setup in Lake et al. (2019). The second uses pseudowords for both inputs and outputs (e.g., dax \u2192 zup). The results are shown in Figure 4b. LMs\u2019 performance drops when the output representation deviates from their pre-training distribution. In such case, even an iterative approach cannot compensate for this degradation.10"

            "text": "We have provided empirical evidence suggesting some discrepancies between the inductive reasoning of LMs and humans. We now qualitatively examine if LM-induced rules are distinguishable from human-induced rules. We conduct analysis on List Functions and MiniARC, as both datasets contain a variety of concepts and represent tasks where the LM succeeds and fails, respectively. We randomly sample 50 tasks per dataset and conduct similar human studies by asking crowdworkers to write the rules. See Appendix C for details of human studies and related human evaluations.\nWe show example LM-induced rules and human-induced rules in Table 2. For List Functions where the LM achieves strong performance, the LM can often induce rules that are comparable to or even better than those from humans, with some exceptions where it incorrectly explains the pattern. On MiniARC, however, it tends to generate rules that are difficult to interpret, often involving verbose and complex descriptions. In contrast, similar to Acquaviva et al. (2022), we find that humans often use pragmatic communication strategies that go beyond pattern descriptions. For instance, they frequently draw upon physical commonsense knowledge (e.g., \u201cdrop or lift an object\u201d, \u201cfill in each box\u201d), use high-level actions (e.g., \u201ccopy or extend the block\u201d, \u201cmirror the group\u201d), and connect to real-world concepts (e.g., \u201cstaircase\u201d, \u201cTetris\u201d). They also pose questions (e.g., \u201cwhich color is more common in a row and by how many?\u201d) and utilize algebraic expressions (e.g., \u201cif a number is repeated n times then only output n\u2212 1 times\u201d) to facilitate effective communications.\n9Given the limited number of exemplars, it is possible that our perturbation results in the task being illdefined. Humans are not necessarily robust to noisy observations either. Therefore, we conduct human study using the same setup and compare the performance between the LM and humans. We find that, while both the LM and humans perform worse on tasks with noisy examples, the relative performance drop of the LM is more significant. See appendix C for details.\n10Dasgupta et al. (2022) has shown LMs demonstrate human-like content effects on reasoning, i.e., they tend to reason more accurately about situations that align with their existing knowledge and beliefs. Similarly, humans are not perfect abstract reasoners, but they can remain consistent abstract reasoning given sufficient time budget (Evans & Curtis-Holmes, 2005). Our iterative approach attempts to mitigate this issue. While we did observe performance improvement (as compared to the results in Table 7), it does not fully close the gap.\nWe further investigate how LMs refine their hypotheses. While we observe performance improvement over iterations (see Figure 5), we also notice that they tend to make minor modifications, typically by adding exceptions for a specific example, rather than starting from entirely new hypotheses. We observe several cases where the LM adds an \u201cif-else\u201d statement to the rules over iterations. For instance, the LM generates \u201cRemove the value 2 from the input list.\u201d in the first iteration and refines it to \u201cRemove the value 6 if it is present in the input list. If not, remove the value 2\u201d in the subsequent iteration. This results in its failure to induce the correct rules if the initial hypothesis is entirely off."

            "text": "Tasks. Humans perform inductive reasoning in everyday situations (Hume, 1904). However, our experiments mainly focus on synthetic and symbolic tasks, differing from the typical scenarios in which humans perform inductions. We chose our datasets based on two concerns. First, we interact with LMs using prompting. This restricts the number of seen examples due to LMs\u2019 limited context lengths. We selected our tasks because they are relatively constrained and well-defined, making it feasible to induce rules from only a few observations.11 Second, the inaccessibility of the training data complicates the evaluation of LMs\u2019 inductive learning abilities. It is challenging to distinguish whether LMs truly induce rules from observed examples or simply recall the fact from their prior knowledge. Therefore, we chose more synthetic and symbolic tasks, as we hypothesize that they are less likely to be present in the pre-training data, thus making inducing rules from observations necessary. Nonetheless, this confounding factor remains unless we fully inspect the training corpus.\nHyperparameters. The goal of this paper is to explore the potentials and limitations of LMs in inductive reasoning, rather than to improve the performance on specific inductive reasoning tasks. Therefore, we did not exhaustively tune hyperparameters (T and N ) or prompt templates. Our experiments use a maximum iteration T = 3 due to the LMs\u2019 limited context lengths and a maximum number of hypotheses per iteration N = 5. Our results demonstrate the correlations between model performance and these two hyperparameters. We expect improved performance when increasing these two hyperparameters, as suggested by Table 1 and recent work by Wang et al. (2023a).\nFuture Directions. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of using LMs as hypothesis proposers. We show that, when paired with symbolic interpreters, LMs can achieve strong performance\n11The question of how many examples are required for valid induction remains a research question (Osherson et al., 1990; Heit, 2000). Arguably, one might only obtain partial observation, and there are cases where humans perform one-shot induction. However, determining the minimum number of examples necessary for induction is outside the scope of this paper. We believe our tasks suit our evaluation purposes despite their simplicities.\nthrough iterative hypothesis refinement. However, out-of-the-box LMs struggle to solve inductive tasks on their own. This strengthens the need to explore neuro-symbolic approaches to utilize the strengths of both components (Ni et al., 2023; Wong et al., 2023, i.a.). Our study also only focuses on a fixed set of exemplars. Future work could explore methods to dynamically select the best exemplars. Additionally, our analyses identify several counter-intuitive model behaviors, highlighting the importance of understanding model behaviors and improving their robustness as future work."

            "text": "Inductive Reasoning with LMs. Existing studies on inductive reasoning capabilities of pretrained large LMs (Gendron et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2022; Moskvichev et al., 2023; Mirchandani et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023a; Han et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023b; Alet et al., 2021; Webb et al., 2023) primarily use IO prompting. They focus on evaluating the accuracy of unseen examples but often overlook any intermediate operations. As we argue in our study, this evaluation lacks interpretability and can conflate with LMs\u2019 rule application abilities. We instead investigate an alternative evaluation by inducing rules from LMs. Similarly, Honovich et al. (2023) uses LMs to induce instructions from examples, but it only studies dataset-level instructions for simple tasks. Concurrent work (Wang et al., 2023a) that proposes hypothesis search is closest to ours, but we focus on understanding the potentials and limitations of LMs rather than improving LMs\u2019 performance.\nLanguage Hypotheses Optimization. Many studies have explored the optimization of hypotheses over the space of natural language. Prior work on latent language for concept learning has mostly focused on few-shot image classification, and often involves training models (Andreas et al., 2018; Mu et al., 2020). Vong & Lake (2022) uses a pre-trained LM, but does not involve refining hypotheses iteratively. Some studies adopt similar iterative frameworks but focus on describing differences between text distributions (Zhong et al., 2022; 2023) or data patterns (Singh et al., 2022). While these hypotheses are relatively coarse-grained, our tasks require fine-grained hypotheses with high precision. Our study shows that, in such cases, a symbolic interpreter is essential to ensure the quality of hypotheses. Additionally, the iterative refinement approach is also related to a line of work on iterative prompting with execution feedback for synthesizing programs (Chen et al., 2023a; Olausson et al., 2023; Haluptzok et al., 2022; Key et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a). However, most of these studies use natural language descriptions, sometimes supplemented with optional examples, while ours only use input-output specifications.\nBayesian Concept Learning. Classical approaches to induction primarily follow a Bayesian paradigm: they start with a hypothesis space, compute the posterior distribution using Bayes\u2019 Rule, and update beliefs based on observations (Tenenbaum et al., 2011; Lake et al., 2015; Xu & Tenenbaum, 2007; Tenenbaum, 1999; Thaker et al., 2017; Kemp & Tenenbaum, 2009). The main challenge of these methods is the trade-off between expressiveness of hypothesis space and computational cost of posterior inference. Therefore, many of them resolve on searching over a constrained rule-based hypothesis space, such as probabilistic programs (Nosofsky et al., 1994; Piantadosi et al., 2016; Goodman et al., 2008; Bramley et al., 2018; Ellis et al., 2022; 2023). However, a domainspecific formulation of Language of Thought (Fodor, 1975; Erdogan et al., 2015; Saad et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020; Sable\u0301-Meyer et al., 2022) is often limited. Ellis (2023) addresses this by performing Bayesian inference over natural language. Our approach shares similar spirits of Bayesian models, but instead leverages LMs to generate and refine hypotheses via iterative prompting."

Iterative refinement operates as a three-step process: hypotheses generation, selection, and refinement. Through our experiments, we find that LMs excel as hypothesis proposers, achieving strong performance on most datasets when coupled with symbolic interpreters. However, we also identify several counter-intuitive behaviors, suggesting that LMs simultaneously behave as puzzling inductive reasoners. For instance, they struggle with applying their own proposed rules and are brittle to minor perturbations.

Here, we study whether more advanced prompting techniques improve LMs\u2019 rule application performance. We consider two alternatives: self-consistency prompting (SC; Wang et al.,\n2023b) and zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting (0-CoT; Kojima et al., 2022; Nye et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022).

We do not observe significant performance differences across these methods, except on ACRE, where 0-CoT underperforms other methods in task accuracy. This could potentially be attributed to the possibility that LMs do not truly understand their own proposed rules; therefore, encouraging reasoning might result in worse performance.\nRepresentation of Hypothesis. We investigate how the representation of hypothesis affects rule induction. We use programming language hypotheses for List Functions and MiniARC. We consider this alternative as existing studies have shown that prompting LMs to generate programs improves the model\u2019s performance on complex reasoning task (Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2023, i.a.). Directly using programming language hypotheses also eliminates the potential issue of mistranslation between natural language and code. As shown in Table 9, both programming language and natural language hypotheses achieve comparable performance, suggesting programming language can be a powerful alternative for these tasks.\nTask-specific Heuristics. One reason why humans can learn new concepts from limited examples is their strong inductive biases or prior knowledge (Lake et al., 2017). We evaluate whether imposing task-specific heuristics influences LMs\u2019 inductive reasoning behaviors. Specifically, we use the MiniARC dataset, which involves visual understanding, and thus object-related heuristics could potentially be beneficial. Similar to Wang et al. (2023a), we provide explicit task-specific heuristics12 in the prompt for hypothesis generation, as shown in Table 10. We observe that the LM-induced rules become more human-readable. The LM starts to use visual concepts (e.g., \u201csquare\u201d, \u201crectangle\u201d, \u201cL-shape\u201d, \u201cU-shape\u201d) and common transformations (e.g., \u201creflection\u201d, \u201cmirror\u201d, \u201crotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise\u201d). We show example LM-induced rules in Table 11. However, this behavior appears only in a fraction of examples, and the rules induced by LMs are still generally distinguishable from those induced by humans. It is possible that incorporating additional guidance or adding human-induced rules as few-shot examples could encourage LMs to use pragmatic communication strategies. We leave exploring these alternatives as future work.\nImportantly, imposing task-specific heuristics does not necessarily improve performance. Iterative hypothesis refinement with T = 3 and N = 5 achieves a raw accuracy of 17.8% and task accuracy of 14.6%, comparable to results without task-specific heuristics. One possible reason is the integercolor mapping introducing additional overhead, as LMs frequently refer to both simultaneously\n12We provide descriptions of the representative transformations from different categories in Kim et al. (2022b), as well as the mapping between integers and colors. In most cases, the color of an object does not have a specific meaning. However, in certain categories, such as common sense, specifying the color can provide a useful cue. For instance, in a transformation that simulates raindrops, recognizing an object with blue color as rain could help reasoning.\nin the rule (e.g., \u201cif a pixel is green (3), then change it to red (2)\u201d). This could also potentially be explained by observations in Acquaviva et al. (2022): human communication is expressive yet ambiguous. Therefore, the more human-readable rules might require extra efforts to ensure precision and improve performance."

Moskvichev et al. (2023) evaluated human participants on ConceptARC, a variant of ARC, and reported an average human performance of 90.9% in solving test examples. Additionally, Acquaviva et al. (2022) found that human annotators were able to write correct instructions for 88% of the ARC tasks."

            "text": "We randomly sample 50 tasks for List Functions and MiniARC and ask crowdworkers to write and evaluate rules. For each task, we ask 3 annotators to write the rule, and for each rule pair, we ask another 3 annotators to evaluate them. For rule evaluation, following prior work (Saha et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023b), we consider two metrics: clarity and supportiveness. Clarity evaluates whether the rule provides a clear explanation of the transformation from input to output. Supportivenss measures how well the rule align with examples.14 We use pairwise comparison with 4 labels: LM-induced rule is better, human-induced rule is better, equally good, and equally bad.\nWe use Amazon Mechanical Turk for all human studies. We select crowdworkers who are located in the US with a HIT approval rate higher 97% and at least 10000 HIT approved. We pay our annotators at a minimal hourly wage of $15. We show the instructions and annotation interfaces for rule induction and rule evaluation in Figure 8 and Figure 9."

            "text": "Human Preferences. We show results of human pairwise comparisons in Figure 6. For List Functions, where the LM achieves high accuracy, LM-induced rules and human-induced rules are comparably clear, but the former are sometimes less supportive. On MiniARC, where the LM performs poorly, we observe a significant performance gap between LM-induced rules and human-induced rules on both clarity and supportiveness. The average inner-annotator agreement, measured by Cohen\u2019s Kappa, is 0.13 for clarity and 0.53 for supportiveness.\nImpacts of Noisy Examples. We conduct similar human experiments using the data with 12.5% noise from \u00a74.2. We consider two setups: one with a hint indicating some examples might be incorrect (comparable to the dashed line in Figure 4a) and one without any hint (comparable to the bar in Figure 4a). We measure the percentage of rules that are preferred or equally good for either the LM or humans, and show the relative performance difference in Table 13. We also show the original human preferences in Figure 7. While both the LM and humans perform worse on tasks with noisy examples, the relative performance drop of the LM is generally more significant. The average inner-annotator agreement, measured by Cohen\u2019s Kappa, is 0.15 for clarity and 0.54 for supportiveness.\n13The human performance was obtained by asking human participants to play a guessing game. It only requires solving unseen examples and did not involve writing rules. See Rule (2020) for details.\n14Saha et al. (2022) use three metrics for evaluation: clarity, supportiveness, and generalizability. We did not consider generalizability as we directly evaluate on unseen examples. Our pilot experiments also suggest that crowdworkers found it challenging to distinguish between supportiveness and generalizability."

Please read the instructions carefully.\nLet\u2019s say you have a mystery machine. You know what goes in (input) and what comes out (output). You are told that the machine works by a particular rule.\nYou will be presented with two rules and a set of examples. The rule describes a pattern in the examples. The rule might use one of the following indexing system.\n0-based Indexing: The index starts from 0. Example: In [1, 2, 3, 4], '3' is indexed as 2. 1-based Indexing: The index starts from 1. Example: In [1, 2, 3, 4], '3' is indexed as 3.\nYou need to first figure out which indexing system the rule uses. Both indexing systems are valid as long as it is consistent within the rule and examples.\nYour task is to evaluate the rules based on the following criteria.\nClarity: The rule explains things clearly and is grammatically correct (ignoring minor spelling issues and typos). Supportiveness: The rule matches all given examples.\nExamples (click to expand/collapse)\nExamples: [2, 2, 3] -> [2] [4, 5, 6, 1] -> [4] [0] -> [0]\nRule 1: The output is the first element of the list.\nRule 2: The output is the 0th item of the list.\nQ1. Clarity: Which one is better? Equally good (Both rules explain things clearly and are grammatically correct)\nQ2. Supportiveness: Which one is better? Equally good (Both rules match all examples)\nInput Output Rule 1 Explanation Rule 2 Explanation [2, 2, 3] [2] Correct, [2] is the first element of the list using 1-based\nindexing.\nCorrect, [2] is the 0th element of the list using 0-based indexing.\n[4, 5, 6, 1] [4] Correct, [4] is the first element of the list using 1-based indexing. Correct, [4] is the 0th element of the list using 0-based indexing. [0] [0] Correct, [0] is the first element of the list using 1-based\nindexing.\nCorrect, [0] is the 0th element of the list using 0-based indexing.\nExamples: [2, 2, 3] -> [2] [4, 5, 4, 1] -> [4] [0, 2, 0] -> [0]\nRule 1: The output is the first element of the list.\nRule 2: The output is the second element of the list.\nQ1. Clarity: Which one is better? Equally good (Both rules explain things clearly and are grammatically correct)\nQ2. Supportiveness: Which one is better? Rule 1 is better. (Rule 1 matches all examples using 1-based indexing, but Rule 2 does not match all examples using either 0-based or 1-based indexing)\nInput Output Rule 1 Explanation Rule 2 Explanation\n[2, 2, 3] [2] Correct, [2] is the first element of\nthe list using 1-based indexing.\nIncorrect, [2] is NOT the second element of the list using 0-based indexing. Although it works using 1-based indexing, it is not consistent with other examples.\n[4, 5, 4, 1] [4] Correct, [4] is the first element of the list using 1-based indexing. Correct, [4] is the second element of the list using 0-based indexing. [0, 2, 0] [0] Correct, [0] is the first element of\nthe list using 1-based indexing. Correct, [0] is the second element of the list using 0-based indexing.\nTask\nExamples: ${examples}\nRule 1: ${rule_1}\nRule 2: ${rule_2}\nQ1. Clarity: Which one is better?\nRule 1 is better\nRule 2 is better Equally good\nEqually bad\nQ2. Supportiveness: Which one is better?\nRule 1 is better Rule 2 is better\nEqually good Equally bad\n(Optional) Do you have any feedback on either Rule 1 or Rule 2? For example, did you find any thing hard to understand? Did you find anything interesting? Is the rule missing any important information?\n(Optional) Please let us know if anything was unclear, if you experienced any issues, or if you have any other feedback for us.

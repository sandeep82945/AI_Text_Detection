    "abstractText": "Transformers have emerged as the architecture of choice for many state-ofthe-art AI models, showcasing exceptional performance across a wide range of AI applications. However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Blockwise RingAttention, which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.",

            "text": "Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have become the backbone of many state-of-the-art AI systems that have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of AI problems. Transformers achieve this success through their architecture design that uses selfattention and position-wise feedforward mechanisms. However, scaling up the context length of Transformers is a challenge (OpenAI, 2023), since the inherited architecture design of Transformers, i.e. the self-attention has memory cost quadratic in the input sequence length, which makes it challenging to scale to longer input sequences. Large context Transformers are essential for tackling a diverse array of AI challenges, ranging from processing books and high-resolution images to analyzing long videos and complex codebases. They excel at extracting information from the interconnected web and hyperlinked content, and are crucial for handling complex scientific experiment data. There have been emerging use cases of language models with significantly expanded context than before: GPT-3.5 (Schulman et al., 2022) with context length 16K, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) with context length 32k, MosaicML\u2019s MPT (MosaicML, 2023) with context length 65k, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude (Anthropic, 2023) with context length 100k.\nDriven by the significance, there has been surging research interests in reducing memory cost. One line of research leverages the observation that the softmax matrix in selfattention can be computed without materializing the full matrix (Milakov and Gimelshein, 2018) which has led to the development of blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward (Rabe and Staats, 2021; Dao et al., 2022; Liu and Abbeel, 2023b) without making approximations. Despite the reduced memory, a significant challenge still arises from storing the output of each layer. This necessity arises from self-attention\u2019s inherent nature, involving interactions among all elements (n to n interactions). The subsequent layer\u2019s self-attention relies on accessing all of the prior layer\u2019s outputs. Fail-\nCode is available. Email: hao.liu@cs.berkeley.edu\ning to do so would increase computational costs cubically, as every output must be recomputed for each sequence element, rendering it impractical for longer sequences.\nThese components facilitate the efficient capture of long-range dependencies between input tokens, and enable scalability through highly parallel computations. To put the memory demand in perspective, even when dealing with a batch size of 1, processing 100 million tokens requires over 1000GB of memory for a modest model with a hidden size of 1024. This is much greater than the capacity of contemporary GPUs and TPUs, which typically have less than 100GB of highbandwidth memory (HBM).\nTo tackle this challenge, we make a key observation: by performing self-attention and feedforward network computations in a blockwise fashion (Liu and Abbeel, 2023b), we can distribute sequence dimensions across multiple devices, allowing concurrent computation and communication. This insight stems from the fact that when we compute the attention on a block-by-block basis, the results are invariant to the ordering of these blockwise computations. Our method distributes the outer loop of computing blockwise attention among hosts, with each device managing its respective input block. For the\ninner loop, every device computes blockwise attention and feedforward operations specific to its designated input block. Host devices form a conceptual ring, where during the inner loop, each device sends a copy of its key-value blocks being used for blockwise computation to the next device in the ring, while simultaneously receiving key-value blocks from the previous one. As long as block computations take longer than block transfers, overlapping these processes results in no added overhead compared to standard transformers. Our work utilizes blockwise parallel transformers (Liu and Abbeel, 2023b) to substantially reduce memory costs, enabling zero-overhead scaling of context size across tens of millions of tokens during both training and inference, and allowing for the use of an arbitrarily large context size. Since our approach overlaps the communication of key-value blocks between hosts in a ring through blockwise computation of transformers, we name it RingAttention with Blockwise Transformers.\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on language modeling benchmarks. Our experiments show that RingAttention can reduce the memory requirements of Transformers, enabling us to train more than 500 times longer sequence than prior memory efficient state-of-the-arts and enables the training of sequences that exceed 100 million in length without making approximations to attention. Importantly, RingAttention eliminates the memory constraints imposed by individual devices, empowering the training and inference of sequences with lengths that scale in proportion to the number of devices, essentially achieving near-infinite context size.\nOur contributions are twofold: (a) proposing a memory efficient transformers architecture that allows the context length to scale linearly with the number of devices while maintaining performance, eliminating the memory bottleneck imposed by individual devices, and (b) demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments."

We compute the matrix of outputs as:\nAttention(Q,K, V ) = softmax( QKT\u221a\nd )V,\nwhere softmax is applied row-wise. Each self-attention sub-layer is accompanied with a feedforward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2.\nBlockwise Parallel Transformers. Prior state-of-the-arts have led to substantial reductions in memory utilization, achieved through innovative techniques that enable attention computation without full materialization by computing attention in a block by block manner (Rabe and Staats, 2021; Dao et al., 2022; Liu and Abbeel, 2023b). These advancements lowered the memory overhead of attention to 2bsh bytes per layer, where b represents the batch size, s denotes the sequence length, and h stands for the hidden size of the model. To further reduce memory usage, blockwise parallel transformer (BPT) (Liu and Abbeel, 2023b) introduced a strategy where the feedforward network associated with each self-attention sub-layer is computed in a block-wise fashion. This approach effectively limits the maximum activation size of feedforward network from 8bsh to 2bsh. For a more detailed analysis of memory efficiency, please refer to the discussion provided therein. In summary, the state-of-the-art transformer layer\u2019s memory cost of activation is 2bsh.\nLarge Output of Each Layer. While BPT significantly reduces memory demand in Transformers, it still presents a major challenge for scaling up context length because it requires storing the output of each layer. This storage is crucial due to the inherent nature of self-attention, which involves interactions among all elements (n to n interactions). Without these stored outputs, the subsequent layer\u2019s self-attention becomes computationally impractical, necessitating recomputation for each sequence element. To put it simply, processing 100 million tokens with a batch size of 1 requires over 1000GB of memory even for a modest model with a hidden size of 1024. In contrast, modern GPUs and TPUs typically provide less than 100GB of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and the prospects for significant HBM expansion are hindered by physical limitations and high manufacturing costs."

            "text": "Our primary objective is to eliminates the memory constraints imposed by individual devices by efficiently distribute long sequences across multiple hosts without adding overhead. To achieve this goal, we propose an enhancement to the blockwise parallel transformers (BPT) framework (Liu and Abbeel, 2023b). When distributing an input sequence across different hosts, each host is responsible for running one element of the outer loop of blockwise attention corresponding to its designated block, as well as the feedforward network specific to that block. These operations do not necessitate communication with other hosts. However, a challenge arises in the inner loop, which involves key-value block interactions that require fetching blocks from other hosts. Since each host possesses only one key-value block, the naive approach of fetching blocks from other hosts results in two significant issues. Firstly, it introduces a computation delay as the system waits to receive the necessary key-value blocks. Secondly, the accumulation of key-value blocks leads to increased memory usage, which defeats the purpose of reducing memory cost.\nRing-Based Blockwise Transformer. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we leverage the permutation invariance property of the inner loop\u2019s key-value block operations. This property stems from the fact that the self-attention between a query block and a group of key-value blocks can be computed in any order, as long as the statistics of each block are combined correctly for rescaling. We leverage this property by conceptualizing all hosts as forming a ring structure: host-1, host-2, ..., host-N . As we compute blockwise attention and\nfeedforward, each host efficiently coordinates by concurrently sending key-value blocks being used for attention computation to the next host while receiving key-value blocks from the preceding host, effectively overlapping transferring of blocks with blockwise computation. Concretely, for any host-i, during the computation of attention between its query block and a key-value block, it concurrently sends key-value blocks to the next host-(i+1) while receiving key-value blocks from the preceding host-(i\u2212 1). If the computation time exceeds the time required for transferring key-value blocks, this results in no additional communication cost. This overlapping mechanism applies to both forward and backward passes of our approach since the same operations and techniques can be used. Prior work has also proposed leveraging a ring topology to compute full attention (Li et al., 2023b), aiming to reduce communication\ncosts. Our work differs by utilizing blockwise parallel transformers to substantially reduce memory costs. As we show in the next section, this enables zero-overhead scaling of context size during both training and inference and allows arbitrarily large context size.\nArithmetic Intensity Between Hosts. In order to determine the minimal required block size to overlap transferring with computation, assume that each host has F FLOPS and that the bandwidth between hosts is denoted as B. It\u2019s worth noting that our approach involves interactions only with the immediately previous and next hosts in a circular configuration, thus our analysis applies to both GPU all-to-all topology and TPU torus topology. Let\u2019s consider the variables: block size denoted as c and hidden size as d. When computing blockwise self-attention, we require 2dc2 FLOPs for calculating attention scores using queries and keys, and an additional 2dc2 FLOPs for multiplying these attention scores by values. In total, the computation demands amount to 4dc2 FLOPs. We exclude the projection of queries, keys, and values, as well as blockwise feedforward operations, since they only add compute complexity without any communication costs between hosts. This simplification leads to more stringent condition and does not compromise the validity of our approach. On the communication front, both key and value blocks require a total of 2cd bytes. Thus, the combined communication demand is 4cd bytes. To achieve an overlap between communication and computation, the following condition must hold: 4dc2/F \u2265 4cd/B. This implies that the block size, denoted as c, should be greater than or equal to F/B. Effectively, this means that the block size needs to be larger than the ratio of FLOPs over bandwidth.\nMemory Requirement. A host needs to store multiple blocks, including one block size to store the current query block, two block sizes for the current key and value blocks, and two block sizes for receiving key and value blocks. Furthermore, storing the output of blockwise attention and feedforward necessitates one block size, as the output retains the shape of the query block. Therefore, a total of six blocks are required, which translates to 6bch bytes of memory. It\u2019s worth noting that the blockwise feedforward network has a maximum activation size of 2bch (Liu and Abbeel, 2023b). Consequently, the total maximum activation size remains at 6bch bytes. Table 1 provides a detailed comparison of the memory costs between our method and other approaches. Notably, our method exhibits the advantage of linear memory scaling with respect to the block size c, and is independent of the input sequence length s.\nOur analysis shows that the model needs to have a sequence length of s = 6c, which is six times the minimal block size. Requirements for popular computing servers are shown in Table 2. The required minimal sequence length (rightmost column) for each host varies between 6K and 10K, and the minimal block size (second-to-rightmost column) for each host is around 1K for TPUs and GPUs with high bandwidth interconnect. For GPUs connected via InfiniBand, which offers lower bandwidth, the requirements are more strict. These requirements are easy to meet using blockwise transformers (Liu and Abbeel, 2023b) and standard parallelism such as data and tensor parallelism, which we will show in experiment Section 5.\nAlgorithm 1 Large Context Transformers using RingAttention with Blockwise Transformers. Required: Input sequence x. Number of hosts Nh. Initialize Split input sequence into Nh blocks that each host has one input block.

Algorithm 1 provides the pseudocode of the algorithm.

We use collective operation jax.lax.ppermute to send and receive key value blocks between nearby hosts. A Jax implementation is provided in Appendix A."

Practitioners can combine our method with tensor parallelism, which we will show in Section 5.2. Using FSDP allows us to set the same batch size in tokens for baselines and our approach, ensuring a fair comparison. Concretely, on n devices, FSDP is used to shard the model for baselines, which gives a sequence length of l. The total batch size in tokens is nl. We utilize FSDP along with RingAttention to extend the sequence length to nlm and m sequences. This means that the total batch size in tokens remains the same, but RingAttention enables a significantly larger context size. Table 3 summarizes the results of our experiments.\nOur RingAttention model consistently surpasses baselines, delivering superior scalability across diverse hardware setups. For example, with 32 A100 GPUs, we achieve over 1 million tokens in context size for 7B model, a 32 times improvement over previous best. Furthermore, when utilizing larger accelerators like TPUv4-512, RingAttention enables a 256 times increase in context size, allows training sequences of over 30 million tokens.

Computing exact self-attention in a blockwise manner using the tiling technique (Milakov and Gimelshein, 2018) has led to the development of memory efficient attention mechanisms (Rabe and Staats, 2021) and its efficient CUDA implementation (Dao et al., 2022), and blockwise parallel transformer (Liu and Abbeel, 2023b) that proposes computing both feedforward and self-attention block-by-block, resulting in a significant reduction in memory requirements. In line with these advancements, our work falls into the category of memory efficient computation for Transformers. Other works have investigated the approximation of attention mechanisms, yet these efforts have often yielded sub-optimal results or encountered challenges during scaling up. For an indepth review of these techniques, we recommend referring to the surveys (Narang et al., 2021; Tay et al., 2022). Another avenue of research explores various parallelism methods, including data parallelism (Dean et al., 2012), tensor parallelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019), pipeline parallelism (Narayanan et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Narayanan et al., 2021), sequence parallelism (Li et al., 2023b; Korthikanti et al., 2022; Jacobs et al., 2023), and FSDP (Facebook, 2023; Rajbhandari et al., 2020). The activations of self-attention take a substantial amount of memory for large context models. Tensor parallelism can only reduce parts of activations memory and sequence parallelism introduces a significant communication overhead that cannot be fully overlapped with computation. Prior work has studied sharding along sequence and attention heads, and gathering sequences via an optimized all-to-all topology, achieving reduced communication (Jacobs et al., 2023). However, this method is restricted by the number of attention heads and requires gathering the full sequence on each device. In comparison, our approach fully overlaps communication with blockwise computation, enhancing its scalability. Prior work study sequence parallelism for computing self-attention using a ring topology (Li et al., 2023b), but is not optimized for blockwise parallel transformers and is incompatible with memory-efficient attention, which are crucial to large context training. Overlapping communication with computation remains challenging, and the communication overheads make it infeasible for training and inference in large-context scenarios. Our work leverages on blockwise parallel transformers to distribute attention and feedforward across devices and concurrently overlaps the communication of key-value blocks in a circular of hosts with the computation of query-key-value blocks and feedforward, reducing memory cost substantially and allowing device count times larger context size with zero overheads. Overlapping communication with computation has been studied in high performance computing literature (Danalis et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2022; Danalis et al., 2009, inter alia). While ring communication has found applications in other parallel computing scenarios (Bischof, 2008; Hursey and Graham, 2011; Gibiansky, 2017; Sergeev and Del Balso, 2018), our work stands out as the first work to show that it can be applied to\nself-attention as used in Transformers and to make it fit efficiently into Transformer training and inference without adding significant overhead by overlapping blockwise computation and communication."

            "text": "In conclusion, we propose a memory efficient approach to reduce the memory requirements of Transformers, the backbone of state-of-the-art AI models. Our approach allows the context length to scale linearly with the number of devices while maintaining performance, eliminating the memory bottleneck imposed by individual devices. Through extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning, we demonstrate its effectiveness, enabling training sequences that are up to device count times longer than those of prior memory-efficient Transformers, exceeding a context length of 100 million without making approximations to attention. In terms of future prospects, the possibility of near-infinite context introduces a vast array of exciting opportunities, such as large video-audio-language models, learning from extended feedback and trial-and-errors, understanding and generating codebase, adapting AI models to understand scientific data such as gene sequences, and developing strong reasoning from link gathering data."

            "text": "The implementation of RingAttention in Jax is provided in Figure 4. We use defvjp function to define both the forward and backward passes, and use collective operation jax.lax.ppermute to facilitate the exchange of key-value blocks among a ring of hosts. The provided code snippet highlights essential components of RingAttention. We provide the complete code on github.\nFor large scale end-to-end training on TPU or on GPU cluster with high bandwidth inter connection, we recommend using FSDP to shard large models and using RingAttention to achieve large context. If total batch size is too large, add tensor parallelism to reduce the global batch size. The degree of parallelism can be adjusted using the mesh_dim parameter within the codebase. To illustrate, consider a setup with 512 devices, such as 512x A100. If the model size is 30B, you can shard it across 8 devices and allocate the remaining 32 devices for RingAttention. This setup allows the context size to be expanded 32 times more than if you didn\u2019t use RingAttention. Conversely, for models sized 7B or 3B, there is no need for FSDP. This means you can utilize all 512 devices exclusively to expand the context using RingAttention by 512 times. Building upon the result that our approach allows for a 256K context size when using 8x A100 GPUs, it suggests that by employing 512 A100 GPUs, the potential context size can be expanded to 16 million."

            "text": "B.1 Evaluation of context length\nIn the experimental results presented in Section 5.1, we used fully sharded tensor parallelism (FSDP) to partition the model across GPUs or TPU devices. Our evaluation focused on determining the maximum achievable sequence length in commonly used FSDP training scenarios. For TPUs, we utilized its default training configuration, which involved performing matmul operations in bfloat16 format with weight accumulation in float32. On the other hand, for GPUs, we adopted the default setup, where all operations were performed in float32.\nB.2 Evaluation of MFU\nIn the evaluation presented in Section 5.2. The batch size in tokens is 2 million per batch on GPU and 4 million per batch on TPU. The training was conducted using FSDP Facebook (2023) with Jax SPMD. For gradient checkpointing (Chen et al., 2016), we used nothing_saveable as checkpointing policies for attention and feedforward network (FFN). For more details, please refer to Jax documentation.\nB.3 Evaluation on line retrieval\nIn the evaluation presented in Section 5.4, we finetuned the LLaMA-13B model (Touvron et al., 2023), limiting context length to 512K tokens due to constraints on our cloud compute budget, the training was conducted on 32x A100 80GB Cloud GPUs. We use user-shared conversations gathered from ShareGPT.com with its public APIs for finetuning, following methodologies as outlined in prior works (Chiang et al., 2023; Geng et al., 2023). ShareGPT is a website where users can share their ChatGPT conversations. To ensure data quality, we convert the HTML back to markdown and filter out some inappropriate or low-quality samples, which results in 125K conversations after data cleaning.\nC Inference requirement\nWe provide the minimal sequence length required to overlap communication with computation during training in Table 2. Our Blockwise RingAttention enables effortless training of context size that scales linearly with the number of devices. While we focus on introducing training as it is more memory demanding than autoregressive inference where the number of query\ntoken is one, RingAttention is applicable to inference too. For example, serving a LLaMa 7B on 32x TPUv5e, the conventional approach is to distribute the model along the attention heads dimension, with each device computing one attention head. Assuming a batch size of 1, this can serve up to a 256K context length due to key-value cache activation size. RingAttention can allow 32 times larger context by circulating the key-value cache between a ring of devices. To overlap the communication with computation, it needs d2/F >= 2*d2/B, where B/F >=2. With a bandwidth of 186 GB/s and flops of 196 TFLOPs, and assuming an unreasonably high MFU of 40% for this large context, then B/F = 2.4, meaning that RingAttention allows 32 times larger context for inference without adding overheads."

            "heading": "D Training FLOPs Scaling of Context Size",
            "text": "Given that our proposed approach unlocks the possibility of training with a context size exceeding 100 million tokens and allows for linear scaling of the context size based on the number of devices, it is essential to understand how the training FLOPs per dataset scale with the context size. While a larger context size results in a higher number of FLOPs, the increased ratio does not scale quadratically because the number of tokens remains fixed. We present these results in Figure 5, which showcases various model sizes and context lengths, representing different computational budgets. The figure shows the ratio of FLOPs for larger context lengths compared to the same model with a shorter 4K context size. We calculated the\nper sequence FLOPs using (24bsh2 + 4bs2h)n where h is model hidden dimension, b is batch size, s is total sequence length, and n is number of layers. The per dataset FLOPs ratio is then given by ((24bs2h2+4bs22h)/(24bs1h2+4bs12h))/(s2/s1) = (6h+s2)/(6h+s1), where s2 and s1 are new and old context lengths. Model sizes and their hidden dimensions are as follows: LLaMA-7B (4096), LLaMA-13B (5140), LLaMA-33B (7168), LLaMA-65B (8192), GPT3175B (12288), and 1TB (36864). These model configurations are from LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) papers, except the 1TB model size and dimension were defined by us.\nAs depicted in Figure 5, scaling up small models to a 1M context size results in approximately 20-40 times more FLOPs, and even more for 10M and 100M token context sizes. However, as the model sizes increase, the cost ratio decreases. For instance, scaling up the 170B model from 4K to 10M incurs 162.6x higher per dataset FLOPs, despite the context size being 3072 times longer."

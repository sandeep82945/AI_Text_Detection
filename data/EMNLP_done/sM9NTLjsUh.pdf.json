    "abstractText": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive performance. However, due to their inability to capture relationships among samples, these frozen LLMs inevitably keep repeating similar mistakes. In this work, we propose our Tuning-free Rule Accumulation (TRAN) framework, which guides LLMs in improving their performance by learning from previous mistakes. Considering data arrives sequentially, LLMs gradually accumulate rules from incorrect cases, forming a rule collection. These rules are then utilized by the LLMs to avoid making similar mistakes when processing subsequent inputs. Moreover, the rules remain independent of the primary prompts, seamlessly complementing prompt design strategies. Experimentally, we show that TRAN improves over recent baselines by a large margin.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance across a broad spectrum of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Prominent models, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), have garnered substantial attention for their proficiency in generating human-like text, driving their increasing adoption in real-world applications (Wang et al., 2023d; Liu et al., 2023b). As these applications involve ever-changing scenarios and specific requirements (Zhao et al., 2023), there is a growing interest in exploring approaches to tailor these models to meet specific goals.\nTo address the challenge of aligning LLMs with human preference, Ouyang et al. (2022) construct human-written instruction data and conduct instruction tuning (Weller et al., 2020) in a reinforcement learning manner. Recent works (Taori et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023) further gain remarkable performance by employing parameter-efficient tuning (Liu et al., 2023a; Ding et al., 2023), which\n\u2217Corresponding authors: Peng Li and Yang Liu\nIf a judgment is based on a stereotype or assumption, then it is not necessarily true.\navoids fine-tuning the entire model. Despite their great success, numerous users engage with LLMs via APIs, posing significant challenges for modifying the parameters (Liu et al., 2022). Thus, it is essential to develop tuning-free approaches for effectively adapting LLMs to specific requirements.\nInstead of tuning the parameters, recent approaches (Kojima et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023) design crafting prompts to guide LLMs. Sun et al. (2023) effectively alleviate the harmfulness of generated texts with human-written principles by specialists. In contrast, recent approaches (Shin et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022) optimize the prompt globally on the training set by instructing LLMs to generate guidelines (Wang and Li, 2023) or criticism based on the current prompt (Pryzant et al., 2023). However, in real-world scenarios, data arrives in a streaming setting (Wang et al., 2023b; Ke and Liu, 2023). As depicted in Fig. 1, LLMs face a continuous influx of streaming data instances, demanding their adaptation to the changing data distribution, in order to avoid repeating similar mistakes.\nIn this work, we address this challenge with our\nTuning-free Rule AccumulatioN (TRAN) framework, which enables the self-adaptation of LLMs to specific scenarios without additional training sets or complementary models in an online learning fashion (Aljundi et al., 2019; Javed and White, 2019). Specifically, the framework guides LLMs to generate rules for subsequent deployment when the generated content is unsatisfactory. By iteratively accumulating rules based on observed mistakes in the streaming data, we construct a comprehensive set of rules. For each input sample, we retrieve relevant rules to provide guidance to the model alongside the initial prompts. Additionally, we devise strategies for LLMs to autonomously manage and maintain the rule collection, ensuring minimal redundancy and contradictions, which further alleviates the potential of excessive growth in the size of the rule collection.\nTo validate our framework, we conduct experiments over various tasks, spanning multi-choice question answering and text classification tasks from different domains. Through rule accumulation, TRAN consistently promotes performance by a significant margin in both zero-shot and fewshot settings. Moreover, as rules are independent of the prompt design, TRAN seamlessly complements prompt design strategies like Chain-ofThought (Kojima et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022). Additionally, by manually adjusting the classification boundary, we construct challenging scenarios that deviate from the distribution of training data, further validating the effectiveness of our approach. We summarize our contributions as follows:1.\n\u2022 We propose TRAN, a tuning-free approach that effectively aligns LLMs to specific scenarios. By iteratively generating and utilizing rules for subsequent deployment, TRAN enables LLMs to avoid the repetition of similar mistakes in a streaming setting.\n\u2022 Based on the rule collection, we develop strategies to autonomously manage and maintain the rules, addressing the challenge posed by the rapid scale expansion of streaming data.\n\u2022 TRAN is a prompt-independent framework that complements prompt design strategies. Experiments substantiate that TRAN significantly enhances performance in both online\n1The code including the prompt templates for reproducing our experiments is available at https://github.com/ THUNLP-MT/TRAN\nlearning scenarios and situations where the full training set is available."

For better illustration, we first present a basic prompt template for the multi-choice question answering task, where xt consists of context, question, and choices. Detailed prompts are provided in Appendix A.2.\nBasic prompt\nContext: {context} Question: {question} Choices: {choices} Answer:\nAssuming the model makes a mistake, we guide the model to generate rules to rectify this mistake. For the sake of simplicity, these rules are expressed in an \u201cif ..., then ...\u201d format in this work. For a better understanding, we provide two examples of generated rules below.\nExp 1: If there is no information about a person\u2019s financial situation, then it is not appropriate to assume that they live in poverty or are wealthy. Exp 2: If the review contains profanity or vulgar language, then it may be offensive depending on the context and severity.\nBy iteratively accumulating rules, we construct a rule collection \u0398 = \u22c3 t{rt}. For each subsequent input xt, we retrieve rules Ruset = {ruset } from \u0398. The selected rules are then concatenated prior to the base prompt, providing guidance for better answers.\n\u03a6t = {(xti , yti )}\nRule Construction\nThe model response is denoted by f(xt, Ruset ). Below is the template for our rule-based prompt.\nRule-based prompt\nRules: {rules} Context: {context} Question: {question} Choices: {choices} Answer:\nBesides, the generated rules are not always practical. Thus, we direct the LLMs to evaluate their ability to fix existing errors. Through this process, we progressively accumulate effective rules. The process of generating and evaluating rules is illustrated in Section 2.3. In addition, to maintain consistency and coherence within the rule collection, we rely on the LLM to assess whether incoming rules are either identical or contradictory to the existing rules. Furthermore, we remove less frequently used rules, thereby limiting the scale of the rule collection. The strategies for managing the rule collection are presented in Section 2.4.\nFurthermore, our framework guides the LLM to handle different components. Specifically, the same model is adopted for various purposes, while for better clarity, we utilize different annotations (subscripts) for distinguishing these purposes."

The process to construct the rule collection is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nConsider that the model makes a mistake on current input xt, in other words, f(xt) \u0338= yt. We first harness the model f to generate rules Rrawt ,\nnamely the process (a) in Fig. 2:\nRrawt = {rrawt,i } = fgen(xt, yt), (1)\nwhere rrawt,i denotes the i-th result rule and fgen denotes the generating process. Utilizing the insights gained from the current mistake, we guide the LLM in generating explanations for the given input question. Building upon this, we then task the model with transforming these explanations into concise and structured rules. Presented below are the simplified prompts. The full prompt scheme is provided in Appendix A.3.\nGenerating prompt (Simplified)\nPlease give the reasons for the answer. Please rewrite these reasons into rules.\nTo maintain the quality of the rule collection, we aim to keep the effective rules only. For each generated rule rrawt,i , we retest the input xt and only keep the rules that can rectify the current mistake. The failed ones, namely f(xt, rrawt,i ) \u0338= yt, are then eliminated. Furthermore, if all rules fail to fix the mistake, we consider the input as a \u201cfailed\u201d mistake and then store it in the mistake collection \u03a6.\nBesides, instead of getting rules from a single mistake, human beings rather rely on summarizing rules from multiple mistakes. Therefore, we further instruct the LLM to generate rules based on multiple previous mistakes. For each \u201cfailed\u201d mistake xt, we retrieve similar old mistakes \u03a6t = {(xti, yti)} from the mistake collection, the process (d) in Fig. 2. Next, by providing \u03a6t along with (xt, yt), we attempt to summarize new rules as\nRsumt = {rsumt,i } = fsum(xt, yt,\u03a6t), (2)\nwhere rsumt,i denotes the i-th generated rule and fsum denotes the LLM for summarizing rules. Similarly, only effective rules are reserved. Finally, with the process (b) in Fig. 2, we get the effective rules Rt = {rt|rt \u2208 Rsum/rawt and f(xt, rt) = yt} for the current input mistake xt and append them into the rule collection \u0398 = \u22c3 tRt."

However, as mistakes accumulate during deployment, the rule collection may become redundant. Moreover, incoming rules are dynamic and can be contradictory, reflecting the evolving user requirements. To address these challenges, we direct the LLM towards maintaining a high-quality rule collection.\nFor each incoming rule r, we extract relevant rules from the existing rule collection based on semantic similarity. Subsequently, we utilize the LLM, notated by fcheck, to evaluate whether selected rules are either identical or contradictory to rule r. If such similarities or contradictions exist, we retain the new rule r only. The simplified checking prompt is shown below and the full prompt scheme is provided in Appendix A.3.\nChecking prompt\nPlease identify whether these two rules are identical (contradictory): {rule 1}; {rule 2}\nFurthermore, to prevent the rule collection from growing excessively, we employ the Least Recently Used (LRU) strategy. When the number of rules surpasses a predefined threshold, we drop the least recently used rules. An ablation study on the threshold is provided in Section 3.3 to assess its impact."

For all tasks, we report\nthe results on the test set. We adopt the \u201coffensive\u201d subtask of TweetEval and randomly select 1,000 samples from the other two tasks for consistency. The details and statistics of the datasets are provided in Appendix A.1. Baselines. We compare our TRAN framework against competitive and well-established methods. Notably, we focus on non-parametric approaches that are comparable to TRAN. For intermediate reasoning strategies, we adopt Zero-Shot CoT (Kojima et al., 2022) and Auto-CoT (Zhang et al., 2022). For the approaches optimizing the prompt, we compare against SALAM (Wang and Li, 2023) in both zero-shot and few-shot manners. Another relevant approach is APO (Pryzant et al., 2023). However, the detailed prompts of APO have not been released yet and we would like to include the comparison after the prompts are released. Implementation details are provided in Appendix A.4. Setup. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were performed using the March 2023 version of gpt-3.5-turbo, leveraging the OpenAI LLM API service2 with a temperature of 0.0. The top three rules are selected with a maximum rule collection size set to 100 over all datasets.

It is noteworthy that SALAM demonstrates significant benefits from few-shot examples, while TRAN maintains a superiority of approximately 2% in terms of average accuracy. Table 2 indicates similar results on text classification tasks.\nAs the rules are iteratively accumulated, we hypothesize that our TRAN framework demonstrates progressive performance improvement with the accumulation of more data. To validate this, we present the ratio of the number of mistakes between our approach and the default frozen model:\nNmours/N m frozen, (3)\nwhere Nm denotes the number of mistakes. Results on three representative tasks are depicted in Fig. 3, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. We choose the range after 30 rules are accumulated,\nwhere the rule collection is roughly constructed. As illustrated in Fig. 3, TRAN has significantly reduced the number of mistakes by approximately 40% and 20% after encountering 700 samples on two settings respectively, universally over three datasets, following our assumption, which further supports the effectiveness of the rule collection.\nIn addition, we conduct preliminary experiments on the Dyck Language (Ebrahimi et al., 2020) generation task from Big-Bench Hard (Suzgun et al., 2022). Experimental results are presented in Table 3 and detailed findings can be found in Appendix A.6. In a nutshell, given the presence of concrete rules for addressing the Dyck Language task, our TRAN framework gains substantial improvement. Further exploration of adapting TRAN to universal generation tasks remains a topic for future research.\nIn general, our TRAN showcases exceptional performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Furthermore, as the model encounters more inputs, TRAN exhibits a greater improvement in performance. For more detailed prompts and examples of rules, please refer to Appendix A.2 and A.9."

            "text": "In this section, we conduct an ablation study of our TRAN framework. Results over three tasks are\ndepicted in Table 4. According to Table 4, we first notice that the performance consistently degrades without summarizing rules from multiple samples. This implies that accumulating experience solely from a specific input is insufficient, which underscores the significance of global insight over previous mistakes, aligning with the findings outlined in (Wang and Li, 2023). Besides, by eliminating outdated or redundant rules, our TRAN maintains a high-quality rule collection, resulting in a performance boost of about 1%.\nAdditionally, we observed a performance drop when the limitation on the size of the rule collection was lifted. For each of the three tasks, LRU removed a total of 10, 39, and 15 rules, respectively. Notably, the Disability task experienced a substantial performance degradation of 4.5%, aligning with the number of rules eliminated. This reinforces the significance of maintaining a restricted rule collection to ensure optimal performance.\nTo delve deeper into the influence of the number of rules, we conducted an ablation study on the size of the rule collection, as illustrated in Fig. 3- (c). The results depicted in Fig. 3-(c) demonstrate that maintaining a rule collection consisting of 20\nrules yields a substantial performance improvement compared to the default frozen setting. This further validates the efficacy of the generated rules Additionally, it is noteworthy that reducing the size of the rule collection has a relatively minor impact compared to removing the limitation, which emphasizes the significance of rule quality.\nMoreover, in our TRAN framework, as rules are accumulated from previous mistakes, the order of data sequences can impact performance. For previous experiments, we used the default order of data sequences. To comprehensively understand this influence, we conduct experiments of various sequence orders. Detailed results and analysis are presented in Table 17 of Appendix 17. Notably, our method exhibits consistent performance across different sample orderings, with this resilience becoming particularly pronounced for longer sequences."

            "text": "Whether TRAN complements CoT? Recent approaches (Kojima et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022) have achieved remarkable performance gains by improving the prompts. In our TRAN framework, as mentioned in Section 2.2, the rules are concatenated before the base prompt. Consequently, we conduct experiments to apply TRAN to these prompt-design strategies. The results presented in Table 5 demonstrate that integrating TRAN with CoT yields a significant performance boost, highlighting the efficacy of our framework.\nHow TRAN performs when the full training set is given? To further investigate our framework, we conduct experiments in a train-test setting. Following Wang and Li (2023), we randomly select 250 samples from each task within BBQ-Lite, and\nwe divided the data into the training set and the test set using a 0.8/0.2 split ratio. Note that only the samples from the training set are utilized by TRAN and SALAM for testing. The comparison results are presented in Table 6. According to Table 6, our TRAN exhibits a significant performance advantage over SALAM in the zero-shot setting. Even in the few-shot setting, where SALAM demonstrates considerable improvement, TRAN still outperforms SALAM by an average margin of 1.7%.\nMoreover, by incorporating a training set, our TRAN provides the model with an initial nonempty rule collection. This mirrors real-world scenarios where humans can predefine basic rules tailored to specific environments. To delve deeper into the influence of the training set, we conducted an ablation study. According to the experimental results in Table 18 of Appendix A.7, the inclusion of a training set considerably enhances performance, with our TRAN framework outperforming other baselines. In summary, TRAN consistently maintains good performance under different settings.\nWhether TRAN generalizes to out-of-domain tasks? To assess the generalization capability of our TRAN, we employ the rule collection constructed during training on the source task to guide the model when evaluating the test set of the target task. The results are illustrated in Fig. 4. Notably, TRAN demonstrates a significant enhancement in performance for out-of-domain tasks across most task pairs. In particular, we observe that utilizing the rule collection from the Physical task results in a noteworthy 10% performance improvement on the SES task, whereas the rule collection of the SES task itself fails to provide a performance boost.\nWe find similar outcomes when employing the Age task as the source and the Sexual task as the target. The top two rules applied to the SES task are demonstrated in Table 7.\nWe notice that although rules are generalized from the Physical task, both rules prioritize social knowledge over physical appearance. This observation highlights the ability of our TRAN to effectively summarize global knowledge and generalize well to out-of-domain tasks.\nHow does TRAN perform in counterfactual scenarios? Given that GPT-series models are trained to adhere to human instructions, we construct counterfactual scenarios to evaluate the performance of our TRAN. These scenarios consist of data distributions that are different from hu-\nman preferences. To carry out this evaluation, we manually modify the classification surface of two datasets, Offensive and Irony, sourced from the TweetEval (Barbieri et al., 2020). We label all instances containing hashtags (#) as \u201coffensive\u201d or \u201cirony\u201d. In total, 476 and 255 instances have been modified, respectively.\nThe comparison results are provided in Table 8. We consistently observe TRAN outperforming all baselines on both benchmarks, regardless of the setting. Particularly, considering the modified samples, TRAN demonstrates a notable average improvement in accuracy. Furthermore, an example rule generated within the Offensive dataset is \u201cIf a review contains a controversial hashtag, then it is likely to be offensive\u201d. This rule effectively captures a portion of the manipulated classification surface, thereby providing additional evidence of the effectiveness of TRAN.\nMoreover, we define the rule \u201cIf the content contains a hashtag, then it is offensive (irony)\u201d, delineating the adjusted classification boundary. With the ground truth rule, TRAN achieves over 80% accuracy on modified samples. This result further validates the scalability of our TRAN, ensuring the potential of enhancing real-world performance by manually manipulating the rule collection."

            "text": "Instruction Tuning and Alignment Tuning. Previous studies (Peng et al., 2023b; Zhang et al.,\n2023a) have explored various approaches to enhance performance and meet user expectations. Ouyang et al. (2022) first incorporate reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017), utilizing human-written data. Subsequent studies (Wang et al., 2023c; Taori et al., 2023) further devise semi-supervised methods to construct instruction-following data. In addition, Sparrow (Glaese et al., 2022) introduces alignment tuning, which leverages both the responses of labelers and rule-based annotations to mitigate unintended behaviors of LLMs, ensuring alignment with human behaviors. To alleviate the requirement of extensive human annotations, Dromedary (Sun et al., 2023) conducts self-alignment from scratch with fewer than 300 lines of annotations. Instead of tuning LLMs or training auxiliary assistants, we focus on developing tuning-free approaches that effectively cater LLMs to specific requirements without the involvement of professional labelers.\nOptimizing Prompts. Previous studies have explored various methods to optimize prompts, such as tuning soft prompts (Qin and Eisner, 2021; Liu et al., 2023a) or training auxiliary models (Hao et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023b). To address the need for extensive model training, the gradientfree prompting technique CoT (Kojima et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023) has been proposed to enhance reasoning abilities. AutoGPT3\n3https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/ Auto-GPT\ndecomposes the target task into subgoals for better performance. Yang et al. (2022) leverage feedback from LLMs combined with external knowledge (Peng et al., 2023a). In contrast, alternative approaches (Yao et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023) utilize the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs to refine the output. Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) retains previous feedback as prompts to enhance reasoning for subsequent inputs. More recently, SALAM (Wang and Li, 2023) further incorporates global feedback to prevent future mistakes. In this work, we focus on aligning the LLMs to meet specific requirements in a streaming setting, utilizing structured and scalable feedback.\nLifelong Learning of LLMs. As LLMs are pre-trained on static data, they may gradually become outdated and misaligned with emerging domains (Wang et al., 2023d). Consequently, recent approaches have been developed to address this issue by accumulating knowledge and ensuring that the model remains up-to-date through lifelong learning (Thrun and Mitchell, 1995; McCloskey and Cohen, 1989). SeMem (Peng et al., 2023c) introduces a complementary scalable knowledge base to facilitate the injection of new knowledge into LLMs. Additionally, a recent work, Voyager (Wang et al., 2023a), maintains a library that stores the skills acquired during the exploration of virtual environments, relying on the generation ability of GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). In contrast, our main focus is to align LLMs with specific requirements, emphasizing the need for customization and adaptation rather than incorporating new knowledge."

            "text": "In this work, we introduce TRAN, an innovative tuning-free framework that enhances the selfalignment capabilities of LLMs in a streaming setting, without additional training data. TRAN utilizes an iterative process of generating and accumulating rules based on observed mistakes, enabling LLMs to avoid repeating similar mistakes. Additionally, we devise strategies for LLMs to autonomously maintain rules to address the potential expansion of the rule collection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TRAN framework outperforms recent comparative approaches on diverse datasets. Furthermore, the rules generated by TRAN exhibit scalability and effectively complement prompt design strategies. Manually crafted counterfactual scenarios further validate the\nefficacy of our approach. Moreover, our research opens up several promising avenues for future exploration. First, our current approach is fully automatic, which faces the challenges of uncontrollable rules. To enhance its real-world applicability, it is imperative to investigate approaches that allow effective human interaction. Additionally, while our work guides LLMs to generate rules intuitively, there is room for incorporating other well-designed reasoning methods. By doing so, we can potentially generate rules that are more reasonable, versatile, and adaptable. Furthermore, we intend to evaluate and advance our approach in dynamic preference environments that reflect complex real-world scenarios, which represents a crucial step toward real-world deployment.\nIn conclusion, the impressive performance of TRAN showcases its potential to augment LLMs in real-world applications and it remains largely unexplored how to effectively adapt LLMs to dynamic environments better."

Currently, our experiments utilize the GPT-series models, which unfortunately are not open-sourced and entail significant usage costs. Another limitation is the predefined structure of the rules in our work. We assume that rules can be formatted in any structure, thus allowing for potential manual manipulation of the rule collection. The exhaustive study of various rule structures remains an area for future exploration. Furthermore, refining other components, such as the retrieval method, also could also enhance the adaptability of our TRAN framework to broader tasks and more practical scenarios."

Rule 4: If there is no explicit information in the context about the resistance to change of either of two people, but one is described as adapting well to a new environment while the other is described as feeling sad about it, then it is possible to guess that the person who is adapting well may be less resistant to change than the person who is feeling sad.\nTable 14: An example of generating rules from a single mistake.\nUser: I am doing a multiple-choice question-answering task.

Please help me classify whether the contents of these two rules are identical. You are only allowed to give me the answer, selecting from \u201cidentical\u201d and \u201cnot identical\u201d. 1. If the context does not provide any information about who embraces change, then it is not possible to determine who embraces change based on the given information. 2. If the context does not provide any information about either person\u2019s attitude towards change, then it is impossible to determine who embraces change based solely on the given context.\nResponse: Identical.\nTable 16: An example of checking rules.\nsummarizing process is shown below. An example of summarizing rules is provided in Table 15.\nSummarizing prompt\n{Summarizing instruction} {Previous mistakes} {Current mistake}\nAdditionally, we leverage the LLM to determine whether an incoming rule is contradictory or identical to the existing rules. We directly exhibit the two candidate rules to the LLM. Both the contradiction and the redundancy are evaluated in the same template. An example is shown in Table 16.\nA.4 Implementation Details In this section, we provide the implementation details. In the few-shot setting, we iteratively retrieve similar past inputs as examples for each input in the default few-shot baseline. The same retrieval strategy is employed throughout the paper.\nFor Auto-CoT (Zhang et al., 2022), we use the official implementation. The number of clusters is set to 4 and the selected examples are provided as few-shot examples. As for SALAM (Wang and Li, 2023), in light that the official implementation is not released yet, we re-implement it according to the prompts provided in its paper and adopt the SentenceTransformer (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) as the retrieval model. The same gpt-3.5-turbo model is employed for both models M and T. Additionally, we consider APO (Pryzant et al., 2023) as a relevant baseline, and we would like to include the comparison after the details are released."

The default data sequence orders are adopted\nin the experiments in Table 1 and 2. In this section, we shuffle the data by three different seeds and report the results on three datasets to further investigate the influence of the sequence orderings. As shown in Table 17, our method consistently demonstrates competent performance across three seeds, in comparison to the default sequencing. Additionally, we notice that as dataset sizes increase, the performance exhibits heightened stability. This suggests that our method possesses an inherent propensity to maintain consistent performance irrespective of the ordering of examples, particularly over extended durations."

To illustrate, consider the following example, whose input question is \u2019Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: [ { [\u2019 and the corresponding target answer is \u2019] } ]\u2019.\nAccording to the comparative results shown in Table 3, our approach gains substantial improvement over the zero-shot baseline. Additionally, we notice that utilizing zero-shot CoT diminishes the performance, in line with the results reported in (Suzgun et al., 2022). In essence, our approach exhibits potential for generation tasks. However, it\u2019s imperative to recognize that a distinct characteristic of the Dyck Languages task is the presence of concrete laws that distinguish it from conventional long-form QA tasks.

Furthermore, the rule collection was updated solely on the training set and remained static during the test set.\nTo gain a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of the training set, we conduct\nadditional experiments concerning the train-test split, as detailed in Table 6. As shown in Table 18, our approach consistently surpasses other baselines when the rule collection undergoes updates on both the training and test sets. Notably, incorporating the training set significantly amplifies the performance. Furthermore, when juxtaposed with the outcomes in Table 6, the continuous updating of rules during the test set yields a modest performance boost."

As evident from Table 23, our approach enables the large language models to produce coherent and reasonable rules. While the most frequently used rules might not always be the most effective, they serve as an indicator of the reasoning and summarization capabilities of our method.\nIn our methodology, rules are autonomously generated, leading to a spectrum in the quality of the rules produced. Therefore, it is crucial to note that during our experiments, we identified occasions when certain rules were flawed, potentially causing the model to make errors. The most common misstep observed was over-correction. For instance, within the TweetEval Irony dataset, the rule \"If the review does not contain the hashtag #NOT or any other indicators of denial commonly used on social media to emphasize non-irony, then the review is not ironic.\" was applied over 50 times. Though this rule seems to capture the ironic nuances rooted in sarcastic contrasts, it is undeniably flawed.\nIn summary, our approach involves the model in both rule generation and assessment, inherently resulting in the creation of some erroneous rules.\nNevertheless, based on our current experiments and observations, the occurrence and influence of these flawed rules seem minimal."

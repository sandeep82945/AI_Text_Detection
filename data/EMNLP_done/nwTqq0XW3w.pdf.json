    "abstractText": "Research in psychopathology has shown that, at an aggregate level, the patterns of emotional change over time\u2014emotion dynamics\u2014are indicators of one\u2019s mental health. One\u2019s patterns of emotion change have traditionally been determined through self-reports of emotions; however, there are known issues with accuracy, bias, and ease of data collection. Recent approaches to determining emotion dynamics from one\u2019s everyday utterances addresses many of these concerns, but it is not yet known whether these measures of utterance emotion dynamics (UED) correlate with mental health diagnoses. Here, for the first time, we study the relationship between tweet emotion dynamics and mental health disorders. We find that each of the UED metrics studied varied by the user\u2019s self-disclosed diagnosis. For example: average valence was significantly higher (i.e., more positive text) in the control group compared to users with ADHD, MDD, and PTSD. Valence variability was significantly lower in the control group compared to ADHD, depression, bipolar disorder, MDD, PTSD, and OCD but not PPD. Rise and recovery rates of valence also exhibited significant differences from the control. This work provides important early evidence for how linguistic cues pertaining to emotion dynamics can play a crucial role as biosocial markers for mental illnesses and aid in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of mental health disorders.",

As our social environments have evolved over time, language has evolved to better support our communication needs and collaborative societies. Therefore, language is also variable, as the way in which\n\u2217Work done while at the University of Alberta.\nwe use it has adapted to cultures and communities around the world, and it is influenced by an individual\u2019s experiences.\nGiven the prominent role of language in human evolution from hunters\u2013gathers to collaborative societies, and the large extent to which we rely on language today, it is not surprising that our mental health impacts our language usage. Quantitative features in language (e.g., aspects which can be measured) have already been shown to indicate and help clinicians monitor the progression of mental health conditions (MHCs), acting as biomarkers. A linguistic biomarker is a language-based measure that is associated with a disease outcome or biology in general (Ballman, 2015; Gagliardi and Tamburini, 2022; Lena, 2021). Some wellknown linguistic biomarkers include: the proportion of pronouns (indicator of depression, Koops et al. (2023)), syntax reduction (Anorexia Nervosa, Cuteri et al. (2022)), certain lexical and syntactic features (mild cognitive impairment and dementia, Calz\u00e0 et al. (2021); Gagliardi and Tamburini (2021)), and semantic connectedness (schizophrenia, Corcoran et al. (2020). Also, the emotions expressed in text have been shown to correlate with mental health diagnosis. For example, more negative sentiment in text by individuals with depression (De Choudhury et al., 2013; Seabrook et al., 2018; De Choudhury et al., 2021). Other work has shown that suicide watch, anxiety, and self-harm subreddits had noticeably lower negative sentiment compared to other mental health subreddits such as Autism and Asperger\u2019s (Gkotsis et al., 2016).\nWhile language can be a biomarker for mental health, the substantial social nature of language has implications. Notably, the tremendous variability in language use\u2014especially across social groups\u2014means that we should be skeptical about universal biomarkers; and instead realize that linguistic biomarkers alone are not capable of predicting MHCs. A vast amount of contextual and\nclinical information (often only available to an individual\u2019s physician) helps determine well-being, and sometimes linguistic markers can aid the process. Further, linguistic biomarkers are more likely to be a stronger indicator among groups with commonalities; for example, when applied to people from the same region, culture, or medium of expression (e.g., social media platform). For example, social factors such as parental socioeconomic status, neighbourhood, and institutionalization (e.g., group foster care by government) influence speech markers such as lexical diversity; and social class influences syntactic complexity (Lena, 2021). Therefore, it is more appropriate to consider language as a biosocial marker for health as it is influenced by both social and biological factors (Lena, 2021).\nAs language is increasingly being studied as a biosocial marker for mental health \u2013 accelerated by the ease and availability of NLP tools and language data online \u2013 there are important ethical implications. We must consider the sociolinguistic factors of such markers to ensure less biased and more accessible tools in clinics (Lena, 2021). If social factors are not considered, then this limits the utility of systems and their ability to predict well-being as they may be capturing confounding variables.\nIn that context, our goal is to understand the extent to which patterns of emotion change act as biosocial markers for mental health? Emotion dynamics studies the patterns with which emotions change across time (Kuppens and Verduyn, 2015, 2017). Emotion dynamics have been shown to correlate with overall well-being, mental health, and psychopathology (the scientific study of mental illness or disorders) (Kuppens and Verduyn, 2017; Houben et al., 2015; Silk et al., 2011; Sperry et al., 2020). Further, studying emotion dynamics allows us to better understand emotions, and has been shown to have ties with academic success (Graziano et al., 2007; Phillips et al., 2002), and social interactions (e.g., shyness) in children (SosaHernandez et al., 2022).\nEmotion dynamics have been measured in psychology through self-report surveys over a period of time (e.g., 3 times a day for 5 days). Using these self-reports of emotion over time, various metrics can quantify how emotions change over time (e.g., the average intensity, variability, etc.). However, there are several drawbacks of using self-report surveys (which we discuss at the end of Section 2.1). Another window through which emotion dynamics\ncan be inferred is through one\u2019s everyday utterances. Hipson and Mohammad (2021) proposed the Utterance Emotion Dynamics (UED) framework which determines emotion dynamics from the emotion expressed in text. There are several metrics in the UED framework inspired by those in psychology (e.g., average emotion, emotion variability, rise rate, and recovery rate). Ties between emotion dynamics metrics and mental health have been shown in psychology, however it is not known whether this relationship similarly exists between emotion dynamics in one\u2019s utterances/language and mental health.\nIn this paper, we examine whether UED act as biosocial markers for mental health. X (formerly Twitter) provides an abundant amount of textual data from the public.1 By considering tweets from users who have chosen to self-disclosed as having an MHC (Suhavi et al., 2022), we can analyse the differences in UED metrics across a diagnosis and the control population. We describe how utterance emotion dynamics (UED) metrics compare between different each of the seven diagnoses (ADHD, bipolar, depression, MDD, OCD, PPD, PTSD) and a control group; and for each MHC we explore the following research questions:\n1. Does the average emotional state differ between the MHC and the control group?\n2. Does emotional variability differ between the MHC and the control group?\n3. Does the rate at which emotions reach peak emotional state (i.e., rise rate) differ between the MHC and the control group?\n4. Does the rate at which emotions recover from peak emotional state back to steady state (i.e., recovery rate) differ between the MHC and the control group?\nWe explore each of the above research questions for three dimensions of emotion \u2014 valence, arousal, and dominance \u2014 further building on the findings in psychology which have traditionally focused only on valence. Our work provides baseline measures for UEDs across MHCs and insights into new linguistic biosocial markers for mental health. These findings are important for clinicians because they provide a broader context for overall wellbeing and can help contribute to the early detection, diagnosis, and management of MHCs.\n1Since this work began before the name change, we use the terms Twitter and tweets in this paper."

            "text": "Affective chronometry is a growing field of research that examines the temporal properties of emotions (i.e., emotion dynamics) and increasingly its relation to mental health and well-being have been studied (Kragel et al., 2022). Within this field, emotion reactivity is the threshold at which a response is elicited and the responses\u2019 amplitude and duration - it can be further deconstructed into the rise time to the peak response (i.e., rise rate), the maintenance time of the peak response, and the recovery time to baseline (i.e., recovery rate) (Davidson, 1998). Emotion variability is how variable an emotion is in terms of its intensity over time and in response to different stimuli. This variation can occur over multiple timescales (e.g., seconds, hours, days, weeks; Kragel et al., 2022). These emotion dynamic metrics are proposed to be predictive of affective trajectories over time and in distinguishing between affective disorders (Kragel et al., 2022). Also, emotion dynamics contribute to maladaptive emotion regulation patterns and poor psychological health (Houben et al., 2015). The meta-analysis by Houben et al. (2015) has indicated that the timescale of emotion dynamics does not moderate the relation between emotion dynamics and psychological well-being. Therefore, the relationship between psychological well-being and emotion dynamics occurs whether it is examined over seconds, days, months, and so on. Average Emotional State & Psychopathology: Average or baseline emotional states are related to well-being and mental illnesses. Due to the maladaptive (i.e., dysfunctional) nature of psychopathology, those with mental illnesses tend to have more negative emotional baselines. For example, Heller et al. (2018) found that a higher average positive affect is associated with lower levels of depression but not anxiety, and a higher average negative affect was related to increased depression and anxiety. As well, those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have reported lower average positive affect (Pugach et al., 2023).\nEmotion Reactivity & Psychopathology: Research has found that individuals with psychopathologies tend to take longer to recover from differing emotional states (i.e., emotional resetting or recovery rate) than healthy individuals (Kragel et al., 2022). That is, difficulty moving between emotional states is associated with lower psychological well-being. Houben et al. (2015) also proposed that high emotional reactivity and slow recovery to baseline states is a maladaptive emotional pattern indicative of poor psychological well-being and psychopathology. In other words, people with poor psychological health may be highly reactive, emotionally volatile, and take a longer time to return to a baseline state.\nEmotion Variability & Psychopathology: The Houben et al. (2015) meta-analysis findings also indicate that higher emotional variability is related to lower psychological well-being. In particular, variability was positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and other psychopathologies (e.g., bipolar, borderline personality disorder, etc.). This is supported by Heller et al. (2018) who found that higher positive and negative affect variability was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety, these effects persisted for anxiety even after controlling for average positive affect. In contrast, variability was no longer associated with depression after controlling for average affect and the rate of recovery to baseline. This effect was attributed to anhedonia (the reduced ability to feel pleasure) which is a common symptom of depression that leads to reduced emotionality.\nOverall, emotion dynamics research suggests that one\u2019s average emotional state, emotional variability, rise rate, and recovery rate may vary by their mental health. Preliminary research suggests that these metrics may also vary across different mental illnesses or psychopathologies. However, research on emotion dynamics within psychology and related fields has heavily relied on self-report measures and ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Affective self-report measures are subject to biases (Kragel et al., 2022) and thus carry certain limitations (i.e., social pressures to be perceived as happy). Additionally, data collection with these methods is time-intensive thus, sample size and study length are limited. Another window through which emotion dynamics can be inferred is through one\u2019s utterances (Hipson and Mohammad, 2021)."

            "text": "Early computational work on emotion change simply created emotion arcs using word\u2013emotion association lexicons (Mohammad, 2011; Reagan et al., 2016). Teodorescu and Mohammad (2023) proposed a mechanism to evaluate automatically generated emotion arcs and showed that lexicon-based methods obtain near-perfect correlations with the true emotion arcs. The Utterance Emotion Dynamics (UED) framework uses various metrics inspired by psychology research to quantify patterns of emotion change from the emotion expressed in text (from the emotion arcs). Using a person\u2019s utterances allows researchers to analyse emotion dynamics since one\u2019s utterances can reasonably reflect one\u2019s thought process. UED allows for broader scale analyses across mediums (e.g., narratives, social media, etc.) and regions (e.g., cities, countries, etc.). UED metrics have been used to study the emotional trajectories of movie characters (Hipson and Mohammad, 2021) and to analyse emotional patterns across geographic regions through Twitter data (Vishnubhotla and Mohammad, 2022a). Seabrook et al. (2018) studied the association between depression severity and the emotion dynamics metric variability on Facebook and Twitter. The UED framework has also been applied to study developmental patterns of emotional change in poems written by children (Teodorescu et al., 2023).\nThis work explores the relationship between UEDs and mental health conditions. Also, unlike past work in emotion dynamics that has focused on valence (pleasure\u2013displeasure or positive\u2013negative dimension), this work also explores the arousal (active\u2013sluggish) and dominance (in control\u2013out of control, powerful\u2013weak) dimensions. Together, valence, arousal, and dominance are considered the core dimensions of emotion (Russell, 2003)."

We describe the dataset in Section 3.1, and our preprocessing steps in Section 3.3.\nWhile our focus is on the relationship between emotion dynamics in tweets and MHCs, as a supplementary experiment, we also briefly explore the relationship between emotion dynamics in Reddit posts and depression.2 Textual datasets associated with MHCs are not common, but it is beneficial to contextualize findings on tweets in comparison to findings on datasets from other modalities of communication. Due to the inherent differences in domains, dataset creation process, sample size, etc., we expect that there will be differences, however there may also be potential similarities in how UED relate to MHCs."

We summarize key details in the Appendix (Section A). The control group consists of users identified from a random sample of tweets (posted during roughly the same time period as the MHC tweets). These tweeters did not post any tweets that satisfied the MHC regex described above. Additionally, users who had any posts about mental health discourse were removed from the control group. Note that this does not guarantee that these users did not have an MHC diagnosis, but rather the set as a whole may have very few MHC tweeters. The number of users in the control group was selected to match the size of the depression dataset, which has the largest number of users.\nFor the finalized set of users, four years of tweets were collected for each user: two years before selfreporting a mental health diagnosis and two years after. For the control group, tweets were randomly sampled from between January 2017 and May 2021 (same date range as other MHC classes).\nUsers with less than 50 tweets collected were removed so as to allow for more generalizable conclusions to be drawn. Similarly, users with more than 5000 followers were removed so as not to include celebrities, or other organizations that use Twitter to discuss well-being."

We found a high comorbidity rate between users who self-reported as having anxiety and depression, as is also supported in the literature (Pollack, 2005; Gorman, 1996; Hirschfeld, 2001; Cummings et al., 2014). Therefore, we removed the anxiety class and only considered the depression class as it was the larger class between the two. We also performed the following preprocessing steps:\n\u2022 We only consider users who self-reported as having one disorder. We removed 1272 users who had disclosed more than one diagnosis. \u2022 We only consider tweets in English, removing other languages. \u2022 We filtered out posts that contained URLs. \u2022 We removed retweets (identified through\ntweets containing \u2018RT\u2019, \u2018rt\u2019).\n\u2022 We computed the number of posts per user, and only considered users whose number of posts was within the interquartile range (between 25th and 75th percentile) for the diagnosis group they disclosed. This was to ensure that we are not including users that post very infrequently or very frequently.\n\u2022 We removed punctuation and stop words.

We compute the following UED metrics per user in each condition, following the speaker UED approach as described in Teodorescu et al. (2023). In this approach, UED metrics are computed per speaker by placing all their utterances in temporal order and computing UED on these ordered utterances. These metrics often rely on the characterization of the steady state or home base for emotions (regions of high probability). Hipson and Mohammad (2021) define the region pertaining to one standard deviation on either side of the mean as the home base. Previous work computed speaker UED metrics for characters in movie dialogues (Hipson and Mohammad, 2021), and for users on Twitter during the pandemic (Vishnubhotla and Mohammad, 2022a). We summarize the UED metrics below (also see Figure 1):\n\u2022 Average Emotional Intensity: One\u2019s average emotion over time.\n\u2022 Emotional Variability: How much and how often one\u2019s emotional state changes over time.\n\u2022 Rise Rate: The rate at which one reaches peak emotional intensity from the home base (i.e., emotional reactivity).\n\u2022 Recovery Rate: The rate at which one recovers from peak emotional intensity to home base, (i.e., emotional regulation).\nFor each user, we order their tweets by timestamp and used the Emotion Dynamics toolkit (Vishnubhotla and Mohammad, 2022b; Hipson and Mo-\n3https://github.com/dteodore/EmotionArcs\nhammad, 2021)4 to compute UED metrics (average emotion, emotion variability, rise rate, and recovery rate). We performed analyses for valence, arousal, and dominance. For word-emotion association scores we use the NRC Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) lexicon (Mohammad, 2018).5 It includes \u223c20,000 common English words with scores ranging from \u22121 (lowest V/A/D) to 1 (highest V/A/D). Afterwards, we performed an ANOVA to test for significant differences between groups in UED metrics, and post-hoc analyses to determine which groups specifically had significant differences from the control group."

            "text": "To analyse potential differences across groups and the control group, an ANOVA statistical test can be conducted, however several assumptions must be met. The three primary assumptions are: the data for each independent variable are approximately normally distributed, the data are independent of each other, and the distributions have roughly the same variance (homoscedasticity). We can assume the mean is normally distributed according to the central limit theorem, due to the large sample size (law of large numbers). Since there are different tweeters in each MHC group we can assume the data are independent of each other. However, we note that people are largely not independent of each other e.g., having friends across groups, interacting with content from various mental health groups, etc. In our case, Levene\u2019s test indicated that the assumption for homogeneity of variance was violated\n4https://github.com/Priya22/EmotionDynamics 5http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/nrc-vad.\nhtml\nfor all metrics and emotions (results in Appendix B.1). As such, we used Welch\u2019s ANOVA test which is an alternative to ANOVA when the equal variance assumption is not met. We conducted a 1-way Welch\u2019s ANOVA for each of the UED metrics (emotional average, emotional variability, rise-rate, and recovery rate) and emotions (valence, arousal, and dominance). We examined a total of N = 14166 users, see Table 1 for descriptives.\nThe first part of our analyses are Omnibus Ftests for significant differences between groups. This test cannot tell us which groups are different from each other, just rather that there is a difference among groups. For each combination of UED metrics and emotions (e.g., emotion variability for valence) there was a significant main effect which means we can conclude that at least one of the mental health diagnoses significantly differed. We show the degrees of freedom, F-statistic, p-value, and corrected effect size in Table 4 in the Appendix for valence, arousal, and dominance. The effect size tells us how meaningful the difference between groups is for each metric.6 For example, 3.31% of the total variance in the emotional variability for valence is accounted for by diagnosis (small effect).\nNext, we would like to know exactly which groups differed from the control group. In order to do this, we performed post hoc analyses for pairwise comparisons between groups for each metric across the three dimensions of emotions. We applied a Games-Howell correction since the assumption for homogeneity of variance was violated. In the following Sections we detail how the UED metrics compare across MHCs compared to the control group. In Table 2 we show the pairwise comparison results for which UED metrics and emotion combination significantly differed from the control group across diagnoses, and the direction of the difference. We also show results on the eRisk dataset in Table 2, and contrast our findings for depression between the Twitter and Reddit datasets.\nWe contextualize our results with previous findings in psychology and studies in NLP. We note that the relationship between patterns of emotion change and well-being for the dimensional emotions arousal and dominance are under-explored \u2013 our findings provide important benchmarks for these emotions and UED metrics more generally.\n6An effect size <0.01 is very small, between 0.01 to 0.06 is small, between 0.06 to 0.14 is medium, and greater than or equal to 0.14 is large."

Additionally, the depression group in the eRisk dataset also had significantly lower dominance compared to the control group.\nDiscussion: Our findings align with results in psychology, and NLP studies looking at the average emotion intensity expressed in text. Valence was found to be lower in individuals with depression (of which MDD is a type of depression) through self-reports questionnaires (Heller et al., 2018; Silk et al., 2011) and on social media (Seabrook et al., 2018; De Choudhury et al., 2013, 2021). Further, work in psychology has found individuals with PTSD and ADHD have lower valence (Pugach et al., 2023; Stickley et al., 2018). It has also been shown that lower arousal and dominance in speech is associated with depression (Stasak et al., 2016; Osatuke et al., 2007; Gumus et al., 2023). While average emotion intensity is one of the more commonly explored measures, there is still relatively few works studying the relationships between arousal and dominance with mental health, compared to valence. Interestingly, dominance appears to differ for many MHCs (all studied here) from the control group, pointing towards an important indicator of well-being."

Interestingly, Seabrook et al. (2018) found higher valence variability on Twitter indicated lower depression severity which contradicted their findings on Facebook. Kuppens et al. (2007) report that valence variability was negatively related to self-esteem and was positively related to neuroticism and depression. Overall, our results align with emotional variability having strong ties with well-being. Arousal and dominance variability appear to be biosocial markers across several MHCs, although minimally explored in the literature (Ranney et al. (2020) found higher affective arousal variability was associated with generalized anxiety disorder)."

Discussion: Rise-rate is analogous to emotional reactivity in psychology, and quickly moving to peak emotional states has been shown in individuals with maladaptive emotion patterns and lower psychological well-being (Houben et al., 2015). It is interesting to note that valence and dominance rise rates differed across MHC to the control, whereas not to the same extent for arousal."

Arousal: The ADHD, depression, MDD, PTSD, and OCD groups showed significantly higher arousal recovery rates than the control group. Dominance: The ADHD, depression, MDD, PTSD and OCD groups showed significantly higher dominance recovery rates than the control group. Discussion: Recovery rates can be thought of as a proxy of emotion regulation, and slower recovery from emotional events is associated with psychopathology and poor psychological well-being (Houben et al., 2015; Kragel et al., 2022). Our results, while pointing to higher recovery rates, indicate significant differences from the control group. This is an interesting result that can be further explored if found in other mediums such as Reddit.\nWe expected to see differences in which UED significantly different from the control between the Twitter and Reddit datasets due to the different mediums, collection process, etc. as mentioned in Section 3. However, we also saw commonalities in that average dominance was significantly lower, and valence and dominance variability were significantly higher for the depression group compared to the control. It appears that despite dataset differences, these biosocial markers are strong indicators for depression. Future work can explore further\nwhether rise and recovery rates act as indicators as well, perhaps by varying parameters involved in computing UED, such as the time-step granularity.\nOverall, we notice that there are quite a few UED metrics across emotion dimensions which are significantly different for MHCs from the control group. Often also, that the direction of difference is similar for valence, arousal, and dominance. Work in psychology supports that often valence and dominance move in similar directions. For example, (Graziotin et al., 2015) found software engineers were more productive when in a good mood associated with higher valence (i.e., more positive) and higher dominance (i.e., more in control of one\u2019s feelings). Likewise, There may be several factors which influence valence and dominance to move in similar directions in the control group and MHCs.\n6 Results: Biosocial Aspects\nWe now explore whether the UED metrics that were found to be significant indicators of certain MHCs, continue to remain discriminating even when accounting for certain social factors such as how popular a user\u2019s posts tend to be. Metadata for the number of likes per post is available in the dataset. So, we simply extracted this information and computed the average number of likes per tweeter. Most users had 0\u20134 likes per post in both the MHCs and the control group, up to an average of 8 likes per post. We compare the average UED per emotion dimension across the various bins of average likes. If a popularity measure does not impact UED, then we would expect to see consistent differences between the control group and an MHC across popularity bins. However, if a popularity measure does influence UED then the differences across MHCs and the control may disappear when controlling for popularity.\nIn Figure 2, we show the two UED metrics (e.g., average emotion intensity and emotional variability) for valence, across various bins of average likes per tweeter for each group. In the Appendix (Section D, E, and F), we show the remaining results for arousal and dominance. If a bin had less than ten users in it (e.g., average of 6\u20138 likes per post), then we did not plot a value for it. In each figure the control group is the blue line (no shapes). For MHCs which significantly differed from the control for an emotion and UED pair, we show the mean difference in Appendix G. If this difference between an MHC and the control remains fairly\nconsistent across ranges of average likes, this UED is most likely not influenced by this social aspect.\nAverage Valence: In the previous section, we showed that average valence is markedly lower for ADHD, MDD, and PTSD. From Figure 2 (a), we observe that the average valence for these MHCs is markedly lower than control for various AverageLikes bins. (We also observe markedly greater differences when average likes is in the [6,8) range.)\nValence Variability: In the previous section, we showed that valence variability is markedly higher for all MHCs except PPD. From Figure 2 (b), we observe that the valence variability for these MHCs is markedly higher than control for various Average-Likes bins. (We also observe markedly lower variability for control when average likes is in the [6,8) range.)\nValence Rise Rate: In the previous section, we showed that valence rise rate is markedly higher for MDD, PTSD, and Depression. From Figure 3 (a) we observe that the valence rise rate for these MHCs is markedly higher than control for various Average-Likes bins. (We also observe markedly lower valence rise rate for control when average user likes is in the [6,8) range.)\nValence Recovery Rate: In the previous section, we showed that valence recovery rate is markedly higher for Bipolar, MDD, PTSD, and Depression. From Figure 3 (b) we observe that the valence recovery rate for these MHCs is markedly higher than control for various Average-Likes bins. (We also observe markedly lower recovery rate for control when average user likes is in the [6,8) range.)\nThus, overall, we observe that for the valence UEDs which showed significant differences across MHCs and control, these differences do not disappear when accounting for popularity measures such as the average number of likes a user\u2019s posts get. Similar trends overall were found for arousal and dominance (Appendix E and F). UED for all three emotion dimensions appear to be robust indicators for various mental health conditions, even when users have some varying social characteristics."

            "text": "We showed for the first time that there are significant relationships between patterns of emotion change in text written by individuals with a self-disclosed MHC compared to a control group. Specifically, we found significant differences in four utterance emotion dynamics (UED) metrics (average emotion, emotion variability, rise rate, and recovery rate) across three emotion dimensions (valence, arousal, and dominance) for 7 MHCs. Our findings provide important contextual information of overall well-being and supporting indicators (in addition to other assessments) to clinicians for diagnosis detection and management.\nLooking ahead, we plan to explore UED metrics across different textual genres, regions, languages, and demographics (such as socioeconomic status), in collaboration with clinicians. Through such a partnership, UED metrics could be studied in the context of clinical information as well. Lastly, exploring new UED metrics that correlate with psychopathology is a promising direction for future work.\nLimitations\nIn this study, we used NLP techniques to compare UED across different psychopathologies and a control group. It is important to be cautious of interpreting these results due to natural limitations within the dataset. Due to the high rates of comorbidity with mental health disorders (Druss and Walker, 2011) examining users who only disclosed one diagnosis may not be representative of the population. Furthermore, it is also possible that the dataset included users with more than one disorder but only disclosed one (e.g., a user may have been diagnosed with depression and ADHD but only tweeted \"diagnosed with ADHD\" or vice versa). Self-disclosure of diagnoses may also be inaccurate due to reasons such as impression management (Leary, 2001) or social desirability (Latkin et al., 2017) where users may disclose having a diagnosis without having received a formal diagnosis. Alternatively, there may have been users included in the control group who have a formal diagnosis of one or more mental health disorders but did not disclose this on Twitter. Overall, despite the dataset creators\u2019 best efforts to collect data accordingly, the users in each group may not be representative of the mental disorders. Future research could replicate this study using a sample of users with confirmed formal diagnoses.\nEthics Statement\nOur research interest is to study emotions at an aggregate/group level. This has applications in emotional development psychology and in public health (e.g., overall well-being and mental health). However, emotions are complex, private, and central to an individual\u2019s experience. Additionally, each individual expresses emotion differently through language, which results in large amounts of variation. Therefore, several ethical considerations should be accounted for when performing any textual analysis of emotions (Mohammad, 2022, 2023). The ones we would particularly like to highlight are listed below:\n\u2022 Our work on studying emotion word usage should not be construed as detecting how people feel; rather, we draw inferences on the emotions that are conveyed by users via the language that they use. \u2022 The language used in an utterance may convey information about the emotional state (or perceived emotional state) of the speaker, lis-\ntener, or someone mentioned in the utterance. However, it is not sufficient for accurately determining any of their momentary emotional states. Deciphering the true momentary emotional state of an individual requires extralinguistic context and world knowledge. Even then, one can be easily mistaken. \u2022 The inferences we draw in this paper are based on aggregate trends across large populations. We do not draw conclusions about specific individuals or momentary emotional states."

They collected a large set of tweets using the regex. This resulted in a preliminary dataset of users with potential MHC diagnoses. To handle false positives (e.g., \u2018my family member has been diagnosed with X\u2019, or \u2018I was not diagnosed with X\u2019), the dataset was split into two non-overlapping parts, one of which was manually annotated, and the other using an updated and high-precision regex.

A user was only included in the dataset if both annotations were positive as self-disclosing for a particular class. A licensed clinical psychologist found the 500-tweet sample to be 99.2% accurate. The manual annotations were used to refine the regular expressions and diagnosis name lexicon. This updated search pattern was applied to the other dataset split.

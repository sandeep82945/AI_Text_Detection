    "abstractText": "Recently, methods have been developed to improve the performance of dense passage retrieval by using context-supervised pre-training. These methods simply consider two passages from the same document to be relevant, without taking into account the potential negative impacts of weakly correlated pairs. Thus, this paper proposes query-as-context pre-training, a simple yet effective pre-training technique to alleviate the issue. Query-as-context pretraining assumes that the query derived from a passage is more likely to be relevant to that passage and forms a passage-query pair. These passage-query pairs are then used in contrastive or generative context-supervised pre-training. The pre-trained models are evaluated on largescale passage retrieval benchmarks and out-ofdomain zero-shot benchmarks. Experimental results show that query-as-context pre-training brings considerable gains for retrieval performances, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.",

            "text": "Passage retrieval is the process of retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus in response to a query, which is useful in a variety of downstream applications such as web search (Fan et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2021a), question answering (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021) and dialogue systems (Gao et al., 2022a; Yu et al., 2021). The success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) (Devlin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019) has led to the development of more powerful PLM-based dense and sparse passage retrieval approaches.\nPLM-based dense retrieval methods (Xiong et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2021; Hofst\u00e4tter et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2021b; Ren et al., 2021b; Ma et al., 2022; Liu and Shao, 2022; Wu et al., 2022;\n*The first two authors contributed equally to this work. \u2020Corresponding authors.\nWang et al., 2022) use PLMs to encode queries and passages into a shared semantic space. The semantic relationships between query and passage representations are then measured by dot product or cosine similarities. Pre-training and finetuning techniques have been developed to improve the performance of dense retrieval models. Pretraining processes for dense retrieval aim to improve the text representation modeling ability of the encoder through auxiliary self-supervised or context-supervised tasks.\nContext-supervised pre-training (Gao and Callan, 2021b; Wu et al., 2022) assumes that two passages1 within the same document are contextual or related to each other and can therefore be used for contrastive learning or contextual decoding. However, context-supervised pre-training ignores the fact that the passages within a document may be weakly related or even irrelevant in many cases. As shown in Figure 1, two passages within a document from the MS-MARCO corpus (Nguyen et al., 2016) are not directly related\n1A passage refers to a long text span consisting of consecutive sentences within a much longer document.\nin content. According to our statistic results via human annotation, only 35.5% of passage pairs in the training data of coCondenser (Gao and Callan, 2022) have high correlation. For statistical details, please refer to Appendix A. These weakly correlated or irrelevant passages do not align with the assumptions on which context-supervised pre-training is based, and are likely to be detrimental to context-supervised pre-training.\nIn contrast to dense retrieval, sparse retrieval is based on the \u201cbag-of-words\" assumption and represents passages and queries as sparse term-based vectors. PLM-based sparse retrieval (Nogueira and Lin, 2019; Dai and Callan, 2019; Mao et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2020; Formal et al., 2021b,a; Mallia et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2022) uses PLM to improve sparse vectors. One representative technique is Query Prediction (Nogueira and Lin, 2019), which predicts a set of relevant queries to enrich the passage\u2019s content and thus alleviates the mismatch problem. Query prediction has been shown to be effective in sparse retrieval, but has not yet been explored in the context of dense retrieval, especially in the pre-training process. This raises the question of whether the query prediction technique can benefit the pre-training process tailored for dense retrieval.\nThe observation that predicted queries align better with the content of a passage in our statistical analyses (see Appendix A) suggests that query prediction could be a promising way to alleviate the issue of weakly correlated passages for contextsupervised pre-training. Thus, this paper focuses on exploring query prediction techniques to improve context-supervised pre-training methods for dense retrieval. Our proposed method, termed query-as-context pre-training, assumes that a query derived from a passage (using a generative model like T5) is more likely to be a relevant context to the passage. In contrast to the previous contextsupervised methods that create a training pair using\ntwo randomly selected passages from a document, the query-as-context method generates a training pair by combining a passage with a predicted query, as illustrated in Figure 2.\nThere are several advantages to using the queryas-context setting. Firstly, the query is more likely to be related to the passage because it is generated from the passage. Additionally, the use of passage-query pairs in supervised downstream retrieval training is consistent with using passagequery pairs in pre-training, which helps to bridge the gap between the two processes. Finally, since the passage-query pairs are generally shorter than the previously used passage-passage pairs, it speeds up the pre-training process and reduces the training overhead.\nTo verify the effectiveness of our proposed query-as-context pre-training, we conduct experiments on large-scale web search benchmarks: MS-MARCO Passage Ranking (Nguyen et al., 2016), TREC Deep Learning (DL) Track 2019 (Craswell et al., 2020a) and Track 2020 (Craswell et al., 2020b). We also evaluate query-as-context pre-trained models on the BEIR (Thakur et al., 2021) benchmark with a large set of out-of-domain datasets. Experimental results show that query-ascontext achieves considerable gains over competing baselines.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We reveal the previously ignored issue of weakly correlated passage pairs during context-supervised pretraining.\n\u2022 We propose query-as-context pre-training, a simple yet effective pre-training technique to alleviate the issue above.\n\u2022 Experiments show that query-as-context pretraining brings considerable gains and meanwhile speeds up pre-training."

Subsequently, we describe the masked language modeling task, which serves as a foundational task of pre-training. Finally, we present two representative contrastive and generative context-supervised pre-training methods, on which our proposed query-as-context will be applied.\nPre-training Corpus Given a set of documents, we randomly extract pairs of passages from each document, which forms a training corpus as follows:\n{{x0,y0}, ..., {xm,ym}} (1)\nwhere {xi,yi} is a pair of passages from the same document.\nMasked Language Modeling (MLM) Formally, given a passage x with n tokens, a special token [CLS] is added to the beginning of the passage, resulting in\nx = {x0, x1, ..., xn} (2)\nwhere x0 represents the [CLS] token. Then, a certain percentage of positions are randomly selected as \u201cmask positions\u201d (mask_pos) and are replaced with a special token [MASK] or a random token. The masked passage is then passed through a text encoder, which commonly consists of L layers of transformer blocks. For the l-th transformer layer in the encoder, its outputs are the hidden states of the layer\nhl = {hl0, hl1, ..., hln} (3)\nThe output of the last layer is then used to calculate the MLM\u2019s target loss\nLmlm = \u2212 \u2211\ni\u2208mask_pos CE(\u03d5(hLi ), xi) (4)\nwhere CE is short for cross entropy function and \u03d5 is a projection of the corresponding hidden states of xi to a vocabulary distribution."

For coCondenser, two passages from a document are considered relevant and form a positive pair, while two passages from different documents are\nconsidered as irrelevant and form a negative pair. These pairs constitute mini-batches for contrastive learning. A common approach for generating an embedding representation of a passage is to use the hidden states of the [CLS] position in the last layer of the encoder, i.e., hL0 . Thus, the embedding representations of passages x and y are hL0 (x) and hL0 (y), simplified as hx and hy. Then, for a minibatch B, the contrastive learning objective w.r.t x is formulated as:\nLco = \u2212 log exp(sim (hx, hy) /\u03c4)\u2211\nh\u2032\u2208B exp(sim (hx, h\u2032) /\u03c4)\n(5)\nwhere \u03c4 is a temperature hyper-parameter and sim (, ) is the dot product similarity function.\nAn additional auxiliary decoder is also appended to the encoder, which consists of N layers of transformers. The auxiliary decoder takes the concatenation of the [CLS] representation from the L-th layer, i.e., hL0 , and the token representations from the encoder\u2019s M -th (e.g. 6-th) layer, i.e., {hM1 , ..., hMn }, as inputs. Similar to MLM, the output of the auxiliary decoder\u2019s last layer is then used to perform an auxiliary MLM pre-training.\nLauxmlm = \u2212 \u2211\ni\u2208mask_pos CE(\u03d5(hNi ), xi) (6)\nFinally, the total loss of coCondenser is:\nL = Lmlm + Lauxmlm + Lco (7)\nFor more details, please refer to (Gao and Callan, 2021b)."

On the decoder side, y is reconstructed using both its unmasked tokens and the contextual passage x.

Following (Nogueira and Lin, 2019), for each passage xi, we use a fine-tuned T5 model for generating queries. We apply nucleus sampling with topp=0.95 and topk=25 to produce multiple queries for promoting diversity.\nSpecially, each passage xi will be fed into the fine-tuned T5 model, and generate C candidate queries, {qij}Cj=1. During training, we will randomly select one of the candidate queries to use as the context for the passage:\nyi = sample({qij}Cj=1)\nThe passage and sampled query form a training pair {xi,yi}, which can be used to replace the original pair used in Equation 1. Specifically, the passage-query pair are directly used for contrastive pre-training of coCondenser. For CoT-MAE, we fed the passage into the encoder, and query into the decoder for generative pre-training. Model implementations for coCondenser and CoT-MAE have been introduced in Section 2.1 and 2.2."

Following (Gao and Callan, 2021b; Wu et al., 2022), the fine-tuning process on MS-MARCO is based on a two-stage pipeline with hard negative mining (Gao et al., 2022b), as depicted in Figure 3. This process involves two stages of training, bi-encoder retriever 1 and bi-encoder retriever 2, which are both initialized with the query-as-context pre-trained models. The retrievers are trained with contrastive learning on the manually annotated passage-query pairs. For a manually annotated passage-query pair (p+, q+), the representations of the passage and the query form a positive example (hp+ , hq+). When training retriever 1, for query q+, the negative samples {p\u2212} include in-batch negative passages and BM25 mined hard negative passages. When training retriever 2, hard negatives are also mined using a well-trained retriever 1 and combined with the other negative passages to create the negative samples {p\u2212}. Both stages are optimized using the InfoNCE loss.\nLft = \u2212 log exp(sim\n( hq+ , hp+ ) /\u03c4)\u2211\np\u2208{p+,p\u2212} exp(sim\n( hq+ , hp ) /\u03c4)\n(12) where \u03c4 is a temperature hyper-parameter fixed to 1 and sim (, ) is dot product similarity function.\nFollowing (Thakur et al., 2021), we train the retriever with MS-MARCO negatives2 for the outof-domain evaluation on BEIR benchmarks"

During pre-training, we select a batch of passages at each step and randomly choose a candidate query as context for each passage to form a relevant pair.\nModel Implementation Following (Wu et al., 2022), the encoder for CoT-MAE is initialized with a pre-trained 12-layer BERT-base model, while the decoder is initialized from scratch. We pretrain the model using the AdamW optimizer for a maximum of 50k steps, with a learning rate of 4e-4, a batch size of 16k, and a linear schedule with a warmup ratio of 0.1. We use 16 Tesla V100 GPUs to train the model for 60 hours, and then discard the decoder, leaving only the encoder for fine-tuning. Following (Gao and Callan, 2021b), the encoder for coCondenser is initialized from a pre-trained 12-layer Condenser (Gao and Callan, 2021a) model. The training is conducted on 8 Tesla V100 GPUs for 120,000 steps over 90 hours using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4, a global batch size of 2k, and a weight decay of 0.01. Once the pre-training is finished, the Condenser head is discarded, resulting in a model with the same architecture as BERTbase for fine-tuning."

The main evaluation metric, MRR@10 on the MSMARCO passage ranking dataset, of retriever 2 improves by 0.6pp compared to the original paper(Gao and Callan, 2021b). When query-ascontext pre-training is used, there is a further improvement of 0.6pp on MRR@10. On both TREC DL 19 and 20 test sets, there are improvements of 2pp on DL 19 and 3.4pp on DL 20. In addition, query-as-context pre-training also improves the MRR@10 and R@50 scores of retriever 1.\nCoT-MAE When reproducing CoT-MAE, for efficiency, we adopt a much larger batch size than in (Wu et al., 2022), which allows us to reduce the number of training steps from 1200k to 50k. This results in faster training, but somehow lower performance on the MS-MARCO MRR@10 metric com-\npared to the original paper. However, when queryas-context pre-training is applied, there is an obvious improvement of 1.4pp on MRR@10, reaching 40.2. Even compared to the 1200k model\u2018s performance in the original paper, we still achieve a non-trivial improvement of 0.8pp. To the best of our knowledge, this is the new state-of-the-art result for a single vector pre-trained (not a rerankerdistilled) dense retriever. On both TREC DL 19 and 20 test sets, there are improvements of 0.8pp on DL 19 and 3pp on DL 20. In addition, query-ascontext pre-training also improves the MRR@10, R@50, and R@1k scores of retriever 1.\nOverall, the query-as-context pre-training approach is effective, improving both contrastive and generative context-supervised pre-training. This is due to two main reasons: (1) Pre-trained models can provide better parameters initialization for both retriever 1 and retriever 2; (2) A better retriever 1 can be used to mine more effective hard negatives,\nwhich further improves the training of retriever 2."

Due to the high cost of pre-training, we directly evaluate the models pre-trained on the MS-MARCO dataset and leave the exploration on the WIKI dataset in future work.\nfor coCondenser, increasing the number of queries from 1 to 5 slightly improves performance on the MS-MARCO dataset and leads to a good improvement on the TREC DL 19 and 20 test sets. For CoT-MAE, using 5 queries lead to an increase on the MS-MARCO dataset and TREC DL 20 test set, while a slight performance decrease in the TREC DL 19 test set.

In a training step, we randomly choose to use either the passage-query or passagepassage pair as input with the same probability. As shown in Table 4, mixing does not improve the effect for coCondenser and CoT-MAE, despite increasing the diversity of context. The decrease aligns with the human-annotated correlation results in Appendix A. The passage-passage pairs have a higher proportion of low correlation pairs, so combining passage-query and passage-passage pairs will be less effective than using passage-query pairs alone. This also indicates that for pre-training tailored for intensive retrieval, the relevance of training pairs is more crucial than diversity."

In fine-tuning stage, attempts includes mining hard negatives (Xiong et al., 2020; Zhan et al., 2021), late interaction (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020), query clustering (Hofst\u00e4tter et al., 2021), reranker distillation (Lin et al., 2021b; Santhanam et al., 2021), data augmentation (Qu et al., 2020) and jointly learning (Ren et al., 2021b; Zhang et al., 2022b, 2021) . In pre-training stages, attempts are divided into two categories. One category focuses on improving the encoder using auxiliary self-supervised auto-encoding tasks (Lu et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2021a; Liu and Shao, 2022; Zhou et al., 2022). The other category proposes passage prediction tasks to resemble passage retrieval in pre-training (Chang et al., 2020; Gao and Callan, 2021b; Ma et al., 2022).\nThe most related methods in this category are (Gao and Callan, 2021b) and (Wu et al., 2022). (Gao and Callan, 2021b) introduces a context-supervised contrastive pre-training process, with the hypothesis that passages from the same document are closer than those from different documents. (Wu et al., 2022) introduces a context-supervised generative masked auto-encoding task via the decoder-side reconstruction task assisted by contextual embedding. Our work is on the basis of these two methods.\nQuery Prediction Query Prediction is a technique originally introduced to the IR community to expand passages. It can significantly improve the performance of BM25 by generating additional queries and appending them to passages before building the inverted index (Nogueira and Lin, 2019). Query prediction has also been used to learn better sparse (Mallia et al., 2021) or dense (Li et al., 2022) representations for documents. In scenarios where data is scarce, query prediction can be used for domain adaptation by generating synthetic queries on target domains for model training (Ma et al., 2020). To reduce noise in the generated data, a cross-encoder can also be used for pseudolabeling (Wang et al., 2021). The most related work to ours is (Li et al., 2022), which encodes each document with a set of generated pseudo-queries to obtain query-informed document representations. However, (Li et al., 2022) focuses on improving\nthe fine-tuning process for dense retrieval, while we are working on the pre-training process."

Random passage-passage pair: Referring to coCondenser (Gao and Callan, 2022), we randomly select another passage within the same document as the context for the passage.\n2. Generated passage-query pair: Referring to the out-of-shelve docT5query (Nogueira and Lin, 2019), we use query prediction technology to generate a query as the context for the passage.\nWe asked the annotators to label whether the random contexts or generated queries are strongly related to the corresponding passages. We manually annotate the 200 passage-passage pairs and passage-query pairs as high-correlation or lowcorrelation respectively. To eliminate preference bias, we divide 6 annotators into two groups. One group annotates 100 passage-passage pairs and 100 passage-query pairs, while the other annotates the remaining pairs. The correlation of each pair is voted by the annotation results of three annotators. The statistical results are shown in Table 5.\nOnly 35.5% of the passage-passage pairs are highly correlated, compared to 56.6% of the passage-query pairs. Therefore, we suggest that the generated query is a more relevant context than the randomly sampled passages. However, due to the limited ability of the base-sized T5 model, nearly half of the generated queries are still not quite exact or strongly correlate to the corresponding passage. We will further explore the potential ability to utilize large language models to generate more precise and semantic correlate queries for improving the performance boundaries of dense passage retrieval pre-training."

    "abstractText": "Mental illness remains one of the most critical public health issues of our time, due to the severe scarcity and accessibility limit of professionals. Psychotherapy requires high-level expertise to conduct deep, complex reasoning and analysis on the cognition modeling of the patients. In the era of Large Language Models, we believe it is the right time to develop AI assistance for computational psychotherapy. We study the task of cognitive distortion detection and propose the Diagnosis of Thought (DoT) prompting. DoT performs diagnosis on the patient\u2019s speech via three stages: subjectivity assessment to separate the facts and the thoughts; contrastive reasoning to elicit the reasoning processes supporting and contradicting the thoughts; and schema analysis to summarize the cognition schemas. The generated diagnosis rationales through the three stages are essential for assisting the professionals. Experiments demonstrate that DoT obtains significant improvements over ChatGPT for cognitive distortion detection, while generating high-quality rationales approved by human experts.",

            "text": "About one in eight people worldwide suffer from mental disorders (World Health Organization, 2022). However, such mental health conditions are severely underserved, due to a number of reasons including the scarcity of mental health professionals, poor quality of services, unaffordable cost, and social stigma (White and Dorman, 2001; Sharma et al., 2020b). Treatment coverage for mental health service use ranges from 33% in highincome locations to only 8% in low- and lower middle-income countries (Moitra et al., 2022). A recent study from the American Psychological Association (APA)1 found that six in ten psychologists \u201cno longer have openings for new patients.\u201d\n1https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/21/therapistshortage-us-psychologists-pandemic\nTo mitigate such situations, there have been consistent efforts on developing automated systems for mental health support, such as sentiment analysis (Rathje et al., 2023) and empathetic chatbots (Welivita et al., 2021; Sharma et al., 2020b; Saha et al., 2022). However, existing works mostly take shallow attempts in a heuristic manner, e.g., analyzing emotions and generating comforting responses. There is still a significant gap for such systems to contribute to real professional psychotherapy, which requires deep studies of the patient\u2019s thinking patterns, the establishment of cognition models, and the methods to reconstruct the cognition models. These procedures constitute the core pillars in common classic therapy paradigms like cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) (Rothbaum et al., 2000; Wright et al., 2017; Beck, 2020) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (Harris, 2006; Hayes et al., 2011). Most data sources recording the interactions between the patients and licensed professionals are confidential, making it even more challenging to build professional assistance for psychotherapy.\nRecent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) development uncovers its astonishing ability in various textual reasoning tasks in zero-shot setting (Kojima et al., 2022; Bang et al., 2023; Chen, 2022). For the psychology domain, ChatGPT and GPT-4 present very promising performance in the classic Sally-Anne test (Baron-Cohen et al., 1985; Bubeck et al., 2023), evaluating the basic theory of mind capabilities to attribute mental states such as beliefs, emotions, desires, etc. We believe it is promising to further exploit such ability to complex mental reasoning and analysis. It is the right time to start developing professional, targeted, and systematic AI assistance for psychotherapy.\nIn this paper, we take the first step by studying the task of cognitive distortion detection, the first core procedure in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) (Beck, 2020). Inspired by how psychother-\napy professionals perform nuanced diagnosis over the patient\u2019s speech, we propose the Diagnosis of Thought (DoT) prompting. In DoT, we diagnose the patient\u2019s speech through three stages: (1) subjectivity assessment, (2) contrastive reasoning, and (3) schema analysis. In subjectivity assessment, we distinguish the patient\u2019s subjective thoughts from the objective facts; In contrastive reasoning, we elicit the reasoning processes supporting and opposing the patient\u2019s thoughts; Finally, in schema analysis, we summarize the underlying thought schema and map it to the cognitive distortion types. We conduct comprehensive experiments using the recent top-performing LLMs. In zero-shot setting, DoT obtains over 10% and 15% relative improvements for distortion assessment and classification, respectively, on ChatGPT. Meanwhile, the generated rationales through the three stages grant full interpretability for the diagnosis process, whose quality is further approved by human experts.\nWe unveil the great potential of empowering professional psychotherapy with LLM. This exploration serves as a catalyst for a larger initiative; we extend an invitation to both AI and psychotherapy communities to come together in a collaborative effort. Our ultimate goal is to construct professional, safe, AI-driven assistance that can substantially enhance mental health support systems."

            "text": "Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is a wellestablished therapy paradigm primarily on depression and anxiety disorders (Beck, 2020). In CBT, given the patients\u2019 speech or written content, we establish the cognitive model by building the interactions among the situations, thoughts, and emotions. Patients with mental disorders, such as depression or anxiety, tend to form negative thoughts very rapidly and unconsciously, leading to negative emotions which further strengthen their overall negative views and beliefs about the world.\nTo break this vicious circle, in a typical CBT process, the first core step is to identify those mal-\nadaptive negative thoughts and summarize their underlying schemas, formally known as cognitive distortions. There are generally 10-20 common, wellstudied types of cognitive distortions. We present a few types with examples in Table 1, and refer the readers to Appendix A for the full list. Once accurately identify these cognitive distortions, CBT therapists will guide the patients to justify and correct these distortions, so as to gradually reconstruct their cognition models.\nIn the real psychotherapy process, there\u2019s a significant amount of textual information including therapeutic conversations and diaries, etc. Such information is often long, highly fragmented, and disorganized, containing multiple types of distortions beyond the toy examples in Table 1. The task of cognitive distortion detection aims to automatically detect the distortion types given such textual information from the patients, in order to assist therapists to enhance their efficiency and productivity. Meanwhile, such detectors can also potentially serve as self-assisting tools for the patients to diagnose their thoughts and conduct CBT practice, upon meeting the robustness and safety requirements. Formally, cognitive distortion detection consists of two steps: 1) Distortion assessment to predict whether the given speech contains cognitive distortions, as a binary classification problem; and 2) Distortion classification to predict the specific distortion types, as a multiclass classification problem."

            "text": "On discussing with psychotherapy professionals, we identify the following key stages to diagnose the patient\u2019s speech to detect cognitive distortions. Subjectivity Assessment. The patient\u2019s speech consists of a mixture of reality (objective facts) and interpretations/opinions (subjective thoughts). In order to perform deep analysis of distorted thinking, we first need to find out which parts of the speech are objective facts and which parts are subjective thoughts. After such an assessment, we summa-\nrize the objective facts into the situations as the evidence base to diagnose the subjective thoughts. Contrastive Reasoning. This stage aims to discover how the patient ascertains the veracity of their subjective thoughts. Based on the situation, we deduct the reasoning processes that supports and contradicts the patient\u2019s thoughts respectively. By contrasting two different interpretations based on the same situation, we can identify the thought schemas more clearly. Schema Analysis. This stage aims to study why the patient forms the specific reasoning process. The term \"schema\" refers to the cognitive structures that organize our knowledge, beliefs, and expectations. Understanding what schemas a patient is relying on can reveal much about their cognitive mode and distortions.\nWe propose the Diagnosis of Thought (DoT) prompting, guiding the LLM through the above three stages to diagnose the patient\u2019s speech. Figure 1 illustrates our framework. We sequentially prompt LLM with three questions for the three stages. After the LLM finishes the generation for all stages, we prompt it with another two questions asking distortion assessment and classification. See Appendix B for all the prompts we use.\nWith DoT prompting, we obtain fully interpretable diagnosis rationales for detecting cognitive distortions. Such interpretability is vital for professionals in real applications. Serving as the diagnosing assistance tool, the diagnosis rationales are essential for the professionals to justify the results. More importantly, they can potentially learn the nuanced thought patterns and schemas derived from the patient\u2019s speech through the rationales. This is crucial for the professionals to establish the patient\u2019s cognition models more efficiently from\nthe vast amount of speech."

For all methods, we first prompt with a general instruction specifying the task and the target distortion types. We compare our DoT prompting with 1) Directly generating the results, and 2) Zero-Shot CoT prompting (ZCoT) (Kojima et al., 2022). For Vicuna, both ZCoT and DoT exceed the token limits for many examples; we omit the results. We average over five runs and report mean and standard deviation for all experiments. Table 2 shows our main experiment results. As we can see, under the zero-shot setting, due to the challenge of this task, Vicuna and ChatGPT still fall behind the supervised full-training models. The proposed DoT prompting significantly\n2https://www.kaggle.com/arnmaud/therapist-qa 3https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt 4https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/\nboosts the performance of ChatGPT, with the distortion assessment score surpassing the full-training performance and the distortion classification score approaching the full-training performance. The improvement over ZCoT demonstrates the superiority of our proposed strategic stages compared with rationale generation with no guidance. Astonishingly, GPT-4 surpasses the full-training performance even by a large margin for distortion classification. On the one hand, this may demonstrate the powerful ability of GPT-4 on this task - it can already reach a potential upper bound regardless with DoT promoting or not; On the other hand, since the dataset we use is publicly released on Kaggle and its original data source is from online forums, we do not exclude the possibility of data contamination. Ablation Studies and Analysis. To better understand how each stage of DoT contributes to overall performance, we conduct ablation studies using ChatGPT shown in Table 3. All three stages obtain improvements for distortion assessment and distortion classification. For distortion assessment, subjectivity assessment (S1) gains the largest improvement, as separating objective facts and subjective thoughts is a strong trigger to assess distortions. For distortion classification, Schema Analysis (S3)\nobtains large improvement, as the summarized underlying thought schema can match the definition of the distortion types more accurately. We also analyze the distortion classification results for each distortion type, with results shown in Figure 2."

However, with the knowledge gap between the two communities, most existing works take shallow attempts without deep investigation of the professional psychotherapy knowledge. A majority of the previous studies targets identification of common mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, from textual contents (Cohan et al., 2018; MacAvaney et al., 2018; Harrigian et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2022; Zanwar et al., 2023; Juhng et al., 2023). Another major category of works study therapeutic conversations with a focus on emotional/empathetic supports (Halder et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2020a; Atapattu et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2023), and discourse structures (Cao et al., 2019; Hsu et al., 2023). A few more recent works have started to investigate deeper professional psychotherapy knowledge, e.g., cognitive distortion detection in CBT (Shreevastava and Foltz, 2021; Ding et al., 2022; Lybarger et al., 2022), identifying and reframing unhelpful thoughts (Ziems et al., 2022; Maddela et al., 2023). Early famous system Eliza6 took the initial attempts to emulate a Rogerian psychotherapist. Due to its rule-based nature, the responses are often reflections or rephrasings of the user\u2019s statements. If users deviate too much from expected inputs or probe its capabilities, the program may produce irrelevant or nonsensical responses.\nRecent progress in large language model reveals that ChatGPT and GPT-4 present very promising performance in the classic Sally-Anne test (BaronCohen et al., 1985; Bubeck et al., 2023), evaluating the basic theory of mind capabilities to attribute mental states such as beliefs, emotions, desires, etc. However, latter works also point out the robustness issue of such ability (Shapira et al., 2023). In our work, we are inspired by such enhanced ability and investigate the application of diagnosing patients\u2019 thoughts in psychotherapy. Our experiments on the real dataset, not anecdotal examples, show very promising performance both in auto-\n6https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA\nmatic and human expert evaluation. We believe it is a very important future research direction to investigate the general cognitive abilities of LLM and make connections to the field of psychology and cognitive science. Theory-wise, we are eager to explore to what extent the LLM can simulate the human cognitive functions, so as to determine the role that language plays in the overall human cognition. Application-wise, a straightforward and encouraging direction should be the integration for assisting mental health treatment, as the motivation and goal of this work."

            "text": "This work delved into the integration of large language models (LLMs) within the realm of psychotherapy. We introduced the Diagnosis of Thought (DoT) framework, which strategically prompts the LLM to produce diagnosis rationales pertinent to the detection of cognitive distortions. We believe that there exists substantial potential for leveraging LLMs within numerous facets of mental health support that are currently under-explored. Our findings, thus, not only illuminate a path towards more efficient therapy methods but also open doors for future investigations to push the boundaries of AI\u2019s role in mental health treatment.\nIn the domain of AI-enhanced psychotherapy, particularly when harnessing the power of LLMs, there are paramount challenges surrounding safety, robustness, and ethical responsibilities. LLM is known to generate hallucinations and biases. While one potential usage of our system is to serve as a self-diagnosing/assisting tool for patients, e.g., to help the patients to recognize their own thinking patterns and learn how the cognitive distortions developed, such tools should not be deployed for direct patient use without the supervision of professionals. As we navigate the potential of LLM in psychotherapy, our foremost priority should remain in building systems that are safe and responsible. Concurrently, the formulation of robust ethical guidelines tailored to this new era becomes indispensable.\nLimitations\nOne of the biggest obstacles to studying AI for psychotherapy is the lack of available, high-quality data. Most of the datasets recording the information of the interactions between the patients and licensed professionals are confidential due to pri-\nvacy concerns. The dataset used in this work is the only one we can find publicly available for cognitive distortion detection, as its data source is from public online forums. In addition to the patient\u2019s speech, the patient\u2019s demographic information also plays an important role in analyzing the thought process leading to cognitive distortions. In this dataset, some of the patient speech include a few demographic details, but pretty minimal. Beyond the task of cognitive distortion detection, the same data constraint issue exists for all other therapy stages and paradigms. This also motivates us to work on building privacy-preserved systems as a crucial future direction.\nEthics Statement\nThe system built in this work are never meant to replace psychotherapy professionals: all systemproduced results need to be verified by licensed professionals. The system should not be deployed for direct patient use without the supervision of licensed professionals.\nThere has been a lot of discussions regarding the use of LLMs for AI-driven therapy purpose. Chatbots will find their most effective role in medicine within the realm of mental health, an opinion7 quoted from Thomas Insel, former director of the National Institute of Mental Health. In the meantime, we should always take caution for such development. Our foremost priority should be building safe and responsible applications while establishing ethical and regulation standards for this new era. Under the current status, the partnership between professionals and AI systems is a promising direction for the goal to ease the burden of professionals, which is the motivation of this work.\n\u201cDiagnosis of Thought\u201d is an innovative approach that harnesses the capabilities of large language models to enhance the field of psychotherapy. It is imperative to understand that this tool is not designed for censorship or any form of invasive surveillance. Instead, it aims to augment the skills of therapists by providing them with advanced, data-driven insights into their clients\u2019 thoughts and emotions. Through the efficient processing of linguistic cues and patterns, these models aid mental health professionals in formulating more precise diagnoses and crafting tailored therapeutic interventions that could significantly enhance the well-\n7https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-chatbotscould-help-provide-therapy-but-caution-is-needed/\nbeing of individuals seeking help. For all the annotations and human evaluations presented in this work, we hired psychotherapy professionals from UpWork8, e.g., certified clinicians, counseling psychology Ph.D. students, etc. We discussed with each hire to reach an agreement on the payment following a fair wage rate. The average hourly rate for all the experts is $80.\nThis project is approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB). The data annotation is classified as exempt by our IRB."

    "abstractText": "Critical toponymy examines the dynamics of power, capital, and resistance through place names and the sites to which they refer. Studies here have traditionally focused on the semantic content of toponyms and the top-down institutional processes that produce them. However, they have generally ignored the ways in which toponyms are used by ordinary people in everyday discourse, as well as the other strategies of geospatial description that accompany and contextualize toponymic reference. Here, we develop computational methods to measure how cultural and economic capital shape the ways in which people refer to places, through a novel annotated dataset of 47,440 New York City Airbnb listings from the 2010s. Building on this dataset, we introduce a new named entity recognition (NER) model able to identify important discourse categories integral to the characterization of place. Our findings point toward new directions for critical toponymy and to a range of previously understudied linguistic signals relevant to research on neighborhood status, housing and tourism markets, and gentrification.",

            "text": "Places are not only bounded regions and the material forms they contain, but are vested with and shaped by symbolic associations (e.g., Bell, 1997; Gieryn, 2000; Tuan, 1977). The names we use for places\u2014toponyms\u2014play a key role in the \u201cproduction of space\u201d (Lefebvre, 1991), stabilizing the social reality of both place associations and place boundaries in ways that typically reflect power dynamics. The fact that New York City real estate developers have tried to rebrand parts of Harlem as \u201cSoHa\u201d (Davidson and Fagundes, 2019), for example, suggests that the area\u2019s previous names were seen as undesirable to the tenants they hope to attract. Critical toponymy refers to the field of research that takes as its focus this relationship between places, their names, and the practices and\nsystems of power that link the two (Rose-Redwood et al., 2010).\nWe apply the critical toponymic perspective to a large dataset of annotated Airbnb listings in New York City, paying particular attention to the sociospatial circulation of neighborhood names. Airbnb hosts need to communicate aspects of the location of their listings to potential renters. Nearly all hosts rhetorically situate their units in a set of spatial identities and relations, but their ways of doing so are diverse. Some use conventional neighborhood names (perhaps including nearby neighborhoods as well), others describe proximity to nearby landmarks, while still others simply describe accessibility to types of institutions and businesses such as hospitals, police stations, and restaurants. Spatial variation in these linguistic strategies of emplacement is the main object of our analysis. In other words, we ask: What can we learn about urban dynamics from the ways in which residents of different neighborhoods describe their property locations to prospective renters?\nWhereas conventional toponymic analysis is usually limited to the semantic content of place names, we expand our focus to include a wide range of linguistic features that reflect spatial relationships (e.g., expressions of proximity, embeddedness, and connectivity)\u2014alongside formal toponyms for neighborhoods, streets, landmarks, businesses, and so on. To extract references to place and spatial relations from unstructured listing descriptions, we train a custom named entity recognition (NER) model on a novel, hand-annotated dataset to identify a range of toponyms and spatial relationships. We analyze these linguistic features alongside a range of sociodemographic variables measured at the neighborhood level, demonstrating multiple associations between toponymic practices and neighborhood status.\nIn doing so, we offer a number of contributions. First, we expand the methodological and\nconceptual scope of critical toponymy. Nearly all toponymic studies have focused on the centralized naming practices of elites such as mayors or large real estate developers, a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach (Bigon, 2020, 3). By contrast, our dataset reflects the \u201cbottom-up\u201d toponymic practices of a larger and more diverse set of social actors at a scale impossible without modern computational techniques. In addition, our NER model allows us to expand the range of place-descriptive resources from the semantics of toponyms in isolation to more subtle, variegated, and relational linguistic strategies, while still retaining an orienting emphasis on neighborhood names, boundaries, and their relationship to neighborhood status and change. Thus, we are able to investigate not only what urban areas are called, but also in which socio-spatial contexts they are invoked by name in the first place.\nSecondly, we contribute to the growing literature on Airbnb and housing dynamics. Others have shown the ways in which Airbnb and short-term rentals (STRs) more broadly accelerate gentrification, widen the \u201crent gap\u201d (Smith, 1987), and remove housing from long-term rental markets (Barron et al., 2020; Ayouba et al., 2020; Horn and Merante, 2017; Wachsmuth and Weisler, 2018). Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to the linguistic strategies that mediate economic transactions between hosts and renters. By uncovering linguistic signals related to gentrification and neighborhood status, we offer findings that can be extended to other residential contexts as well \u2014 in particular where new avenues for \u201ctechnologically and culturally driven\u201d gentrification (Wachsmuth and Weisler, 2018) are being opened up by the growing sector of \u201cplatform real estate\u201d (Fields and Rogers, 2021).\nFinally, we offer two methodological contributions. First, we introduce a new schema for geospatial NER labeling and a corresponding human-annotated dataset with accompanying models. While this data is particular to New York City, our model is able to generalize beyond the annotated entities in the training data (see Appendix B). Second, we propose a set of new lightweight but accurate methods for toponymy resolution and geospatial dependency parsing. To anticipate our results, our models considerably outperform offthe-shelf NER models on our data and task (see Table 1). This suggests that NER applications to social science at the local level will benefit from, if\nnot require, specialized models such as ours. Our training data and models are publicly available on Github.1"

            "text": "Whereas early studies of toponymy were oriented toward the enumeration, etymology, and taxonomy of place names\u2014with early practitioners likening the toponymist to a \u201cbotanical collector\u201d (Wright, 1929, 140)\u2014the \u201ccritical turn\u201d (Rose-Redwood et al., 2010; Medway and Warnaby, 2014) since the 1980s has shifted attention toward place naming practices and their relation to social and political life: ethnic tensions, regime changes, collective memory, commercialization, and so on. In imperial contexts, for example, colonizers often rename(d) territories, cities, and streets to reflect their own ethnolinguistic background and political ideals (Carter, 2013; Wanjiru-Mwita and Giraut, 2020), while the re-imposition of indigenous toponyms is an early form of action by many post-liberation groups (Mamvura et al., 2018; Njoh, 2017; Wanjiru and Matsubara, 2017). In specifically urban contexts, critical toponymy has examined street, neighborhood, and landmark names as they relate to politics and diplomacy (Rusu, 2019; Sysi\u00f6 et al., 2023), to the corporatization of public spaces (Light and Young, 2015) and to shifting neighborhood status hierarchies and gentrification (Masuda and Bookman, 2018; Madden, 2018).\nWhat nearly all of these studies have in common is a focus on the ways in which powerfully situated actors make decisions about \u201cofficial\u201d place names: mayors renaming streets to honor local heroes, corporations renaming sports stadiums, or real estate developers rebranding low-status neighborhoods in their efforts to attract residents to new apartment compounds. While such actors exert tremendous influence on the toponymic landscape, toponymic adoption by the urban population is neither guaranteed (e.g., Hui, 2019) nor well studied (Light and Young, 2017).\nA major contribution here, therefore, is to examine toponymic reference among thousands of Airbnb hosts and customers whose ways of inscribing urban space do not necessarily conform to those of developers or city planners. While GIS scholars have studied Airbnb at length\u2014for example, its patterns of expansion (Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2017) and role\n1https://github.com/maybemkl/airbnb-place-ner\nin gentrification (Wachsmuth and Weisler, 2018)\u2014 nobody has of yet combined geospatial analysis of Airbnbs with toponymic analysis. In so doing, we heed continued calls to situate embedding-based approaches to language analysis alongside or within other data structures reflecting forms of, for example, spatiotemporal and socio-interactional variation (Bender and Koller, 2020; Brunila and LaViolette, 2022). While NLP methods have previously been used to study Airbnb, we are unaware of previous work that extracts spatial entities and their relations from texts on the platform.\nOur approach contributes to a greater understanding of how factors such as gentrification mediate the extent to which cultural signifiers are adopted on the ground. Neighborhood names are particularly suited to this goal, as their boundaries are more ambiguous and fast-changing than other sorts of toponyms. Further, Airbnb data is particularly apt for the critical toponymy perspective, given its simultaneous embeddedness in economic interactions and geospatial structure."

            "text": "Beyond the theoretical considerations of critical toponymy, the tasks of extracting place names from\nunstructured text and determining their geospatial referents\u2014a process called \u201cgeo-parsing\u201d (Jones and Purves, 2008, 220)\u2014present numerous practical challenges. The case of New York neighborhoods illustrates this well. For starters, there is no official set of neighborhood names and boundaries in New York. While the NYC Department of Planning offers its own map, it cautions that \u201cneighborhood names are not officially designated,\u201d2 while a dataset maintained by the nonprofit BetaNYC notes that neighborhood \u201cboundaries may overlap, some neighborhoods may function as a microneighborhood within another neighborhood, or a larger district which can be made up of multiple neighborhoods.\u201d3\nAnother complication comes from the fact that even if there were a ground-truth dataset of neighborhood names and boundaries, they still need to be mapped to observed tokens in the Airbnb data. Neighborhood names in general, and not least in New York, are often informal and vernacular, including truncations and abbreviations (such as FiDi for the Financial District), as well as multilingual\n2https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/ city-neighborhoods.page\n3https://data.beta.nyc/dataset/ pediacities-nyc-neighborhoods\nnames (such as El Barrio for East Harlem) (Hu et al., 2019). In relatively informal written corpora such as Airbnb data, neighborhoods are frequently misspelled or abbreviated in non-standard ways (such as wb for Williamsburg).\nThus, from an engineering perspective, toponymic analysis requires two steps: toponymy detection and toponymy resolution (Wang et al., 2020; Jones and Purves, 2008). First, toponyms have to be detected among the set of words comprising a text, a variant of the general task of named entity recognition. For specialized contexts such as ours, off-the-shelf NER models frequently fail to identify tokens of interest for the reasons mentioned above (again, see Table 1). Secondly, ambiguities introduced by the fact that different names can refer to the same place, and that the same name can refer to different places, are not necessarily identifiable from textual context alone and must be resolved. There is no gold-standard approach to toponymy resolution. Here, we synthesize multiple approaches as described in Section 4.4."

These include categories for entities such as neighborhoods, streets, transit stations, parks, and businesses. Four of the remaining five categories refer to non-named, generic references to types of institutions whose presence nevertheless meaningfully characterizes urban space. The final category refers not to places or things per se, but to spatio-temporal relations: expressions of proximity, distance, and adjacency. By including these final five non-toponymic categories in our model, we expand the range of descriptive strategies people use to construct linguistic cartographies that our model is able to address. Appendix D defines all 21 categories and provides examples.\nThe schema was developed with initial reference to a set of categories suggested by (Cadorel et al., 2021), and was iteratively expanded and modified from their original 4 labels in Cadorel et al. to 14 labels in some of our preliminary work (Brunila et al., 2023), and finally to the 21 labels used here. All annotation was performed using Prodigy6 following an initial training session where annotators collaboratively annotated a randomly chosen set of samples. This first round of annotation identified points of ambiguity and disagreement. The\n6https://prodi.gy/\nlast round of annotation, on which the final model was trained, involved re-labeling all roughly 2,700 training examples and was performed by the two lead coders only.\nInter-annotator agreement was examined across 107 listings (a random stratified sample to achieve a sufficiently representative spatial distribution). Both lead coders separately annotated each document, and then each unique span tagged by either author was extracted (N=1,554). Treating one coder\u2019s tags as \u201ctrue\u201d and the other\u2019s as \u201cpredicted\u201d yielded a weighted F1 score of 0.822 across all label categories. This measure of agreement is arguably conservative insofar as it requires exact span matches, e.g., \u201cThe MoMA\u201d and \u201cMoMA\u201d would be treated as divergent predictions in the calculation of the F1 score."

We call tokens\nreflecting these relations Spatio-Temporal Entities (STEs). STEs such as \u201c5 minutes from\u201d or \u201cwalking distance\u201d were tagged along with toponyms and other spatial entities. However, to move beyond a bag-of-words relationship between tags, we also parse dependencies between STEs and toponyms.\nFirst, we label our corpus using the NER model described above. Next, we split each document into sentences and parse for dependencies between tokens using spaCy\u2019s transition-based dependency parser.7 If a token also has a NER label, it is merged with any token belonging to the same IOB-chunk, inheriting all dependencies from its individual tokens. All tokens merged into entities and the remaining non-entity tokens effectively form a directed graph, which is filtered for any nodes that are labeled \u201cSTE\u201d; all dependencies that point to these nodes are removed.\nWhat remains is a set of weakly connected subgraphs that each have at most one STE node and n nodes with other labels, including toponyms. If any of these nodes is a toponym, the STE must refer to it, yielding a final set of individual STE nodes and their dependent toponyms. This process is illustrated in Figure 2, where the sentence is initially one graph, that is then split into subgraphs at \u201cWalking distance to\u201d and \u201cvery close to\u201d, both with several dependent toponyms."

Second, the locations of the listings mentioning these toponyms are then used as input for a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) model that filters out locations more than two standard deviations from the mean of the distribution. Thirdly, the remaining listings yield a convex hull for the span of each unique, \u201cnoncanonical\u201d toponym. Finally, the n nearest centroids of canonical neighborhood hulls are selected for closer analysis. Out of the n nearest canonical toponyms, we next examine which are: (a) the k nearest neighbors in terms of cosine similarity using both word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017) models trained on the listing and review texts, and (b) the m nearest neighbors in terms of Jaro-Winkler (Jaro, 1989; Winkler, 1990) distance, i.e. in terms of spelling similarity. Then, each neighborhood toponym outside the canonical set is assigned to the canonical toponym that scores best on these ensemble criteria. To validate the findings of this paper, we finally also went over this list and corrected it manually (for further details and F1-scores, see Appendix C)"

            "text": "We begin with a simple demonstration that validates a relationship between neighborhood names and urban geospatial structure. To do so, we ask how frequently Airbnb listings in different neighborhoods mention their neighborhood by name, using toponymy resolution to capture misspellings and alternate usages. If such a relationship exists, we would expect listings in more central or otherwise desirable locations to invoke neighborhood names more frequently than those in less desirable areas. Figure 3 (a) plots this relationship, and indeed we see that this is generally the case: neighborhoods at the fringes of the city toponymically self-reference much less frequently than central neighborhoods. In other words, we begin to see that urban dynamics such as centrality and periphery are inscribed in \u201cbottom-up\u201d toponymic practices at scale. Furthermore, from Figure 1 we can see that listings also reference neighborhoods outside of their own location, generating a toponymic hierarchi of sorts.\nThese measures entail a major shortcoming, however: it assumes that the canonical neighborhoods we use align with the way Airbnb users imagine urban space. A host might in fact refer to their\nlisting\u2019s location by neighborhood name, but they claim to be in a neighborhood other than what our geometries assume. This observation is suggestive of the idea of \u201cvague cognitive regions\u201d in geographical research: the variable ways that people categorize and break up geographic space, both cognitively and in discourse (Gao et al., 2017; Montello et al., 2014).\nTo investigate how cultural factors shape these cognitive regions, regardless of their relationship to canonical neighborhood boundaries, we proceed to a second analysis in which we use the spatiotemporal entity class of our NER model to induce toponymic spans."

Using dependency parsing (Figure 2), we identify when a neighborhood toponym occurs as the syntactic child of any STE that indicate membership: in the heart of, central to, etc. (see Appendix F). This allows us to plot the geographic span of claims to neighborhood membership against the coordinates of corresponding Airbnb units.\nTo calculate a neighborhood\u2019s toponymic span, we take the convex hull of the points corresponding to membership claims, again employing KDE to remove any listings two standard deviations away from the distribution mean (for KDE details, see Appendix C). We take the area of the convex hull of this resulting set of coordinates, which can be compared to the area of the canonical neighborhood, as can be seen in Figure 3 (b).\nFigure 4 visualizes this process in more detail for two neighborhoods: Williamsburg and BedfordStuyvesant (\u201cBed-Stuy\u201d). The two neighborhoods are similar in many ways: both are quite large, contain high rates of Airbnbs, and are adjacent to one another. Both are centrally located to North Brooklyn and relatively well connected to the city by subway. While each has been the site of gentrification, attracting many young \u201ctransplants\u201d moving to New York, Williamsburg is widely cited as one\nof the most intense sites of gentrification in the city for two decades (see, e.g., Curran, 2007) and has been dubbed \u201cthe original hipster breeding ground\u201d of 21st-century Brooklyn (Schiermer, 2014, 170). In this sense, Bed-Stuy lags behind, still attracting young transplants but with 25% lower median rents (Johnson et al., 2022, data appendix)8 and generally lacking the desirability and fame (or notoriety) of Williamsburg.\nThese differences in prestige are revealed through practices of toponymic inscription at scale. The left column of Figure 4 displays all mentions of each neighborhood, without filtering for membership claims (\u201clocated in\u201d) or Kernel Density outliers. As we can see, Airbnb hosts across four city boroughs (excepting Staten Island) situate their locations with reference to Williamsburg, regardless of how they do so. By contrast, references to Bed-Stuy are much more locally concentrated, suggesting the lesser prestige attached to the neighborhood name. After filtering for usages that occur in the context of a membership claim and removing outliers with Mahalanobis filtering, the spans for both shrink considerably. Nevertheless, the ratio of the filtered span area to the underlying canonical\n8Johnson et al. (2022) uses different canonical boundaries than we do. In their data, we define \u201cBed-Stuy\u201d as all tracts in what they call Bedford and Stuyvesant Heights, and \u201cWilliamsburg\u201d as all tracts in Williamsburg and North Side-South Side.\narea is much higher for Williamsburg (6.929) than for Bed-Stuy (2.027), showing how local prestige can \u201cstretch\u201d an area\u2019s collective cognitive region.\nWhile the comparison of these two neighborhoods serves as a useful demonstration, Figure 5 (panel 3) shows that the Pearson correlation between toponymic span and gentrification\u2014 operationalized with a state-of-the-art small-area index of gentrification (Johnson et al., 2022)\u2014 persists across the dataset (r = .35)9. The rightmost panel of Figure 5 displays the negative correlation between gentrification and toponymic reference other than neighborhood names. In other words, neighborhoods which have yet to gentrify invoke toponyms to situate their listings, but they are more likely to invoke other signposts\u2014transit stations, businesses, or airports, for example\u2014to communicate the location of their units."

Mining text data to discover place names is an old task in data science (e.g., Twaroch et al., 2008). Recent innovations in embedding-based models have greatly improved our ability to infer toponyms in\n9We got similar outcomes using Local Outlier Factor, Mahalanobis distance, and Isolation Forest to filter span outliers.\nunstructured text data. Thus far, such work in the context of toponymy has generally been explored as an engineering challenge to be improved upon with increasingly sophisticated methods (e.g., Cardoso et al., 2022; Davari et al., 2020; Fize et al., 2021; Tao et al., 2022). While such efforts are invaluable to engineers and social scientists alike, few have extended these novel approaches to concrete questions of social scientific intrigue.\nHere we offer preliminary steps in this direction, introducing novel data and a bespoke NER model\nto investigate the relationship between bottom-up toponymic practices and neighborhood status in the context of the Airbnb market. We demonstrate multiple ways in which the toponymic language reflects a variety of urban geospatial and sociocultural dynamics. Not all hosts locate their units in reference to their residential neighborhood. With some exceptions\u2014an exploration of which would require a much more fine-grained discussion of the idiosyncrasies of New York City neighborhoods than is appropriate here\u2014more peripheral neigh-\nborhoods are less likely to use neighborhood names to situate their locations, suggesting how urban dynamics of center and periphery come to be expressed in toponymic reference at scale.\nFurthermore, we identify a relationship between gentrification dynamics and what we call toponymy span: the ratio between the area within which people claim membership in a neighborhood, and the area of its canonical boundaries. Given the demonstrated association between Airbnbs and gentrification (suggested by our data as well; see Figure 5, leftmost panel), this points to the possibility of a circular process. As a neighborhood gentrifies and acquires desirability among a class of largely white, middle- and upper-middle class, young professionals, Airbnb hosts and guests at the geographic fringes of those neighborhoods become more likely to locate themselves within it. Identifying themselves with new desirable toponyms might proceed to attract guests with greater efficacy, increasing the \u201crent gap\u201d introduced by Airbnbs (Wachsmuth and Weisler, 2018) and perhaps accelerating the gentrification processes set in motion by STRs. While such causal dynamics would be difficult to properly model, and we certainly do not do so here, our findings in combination with prior research on the effect of Airbnbs suggest that toponymic practices might not merely reflect ongoing urban change, but play a more active role therein."

Future work should investigate toponymic practices of different kinds. Larger text corpora, spanning longer periods of time, could reveal how these dynamics\u2014for example, the relationship between toponym span and gentrification\u2014play out diachronically. Many conventional indicators of gentrification process are measured with Census data that may lag behind the on-the-ground experience and economic effects of gentrification. If such linguistic signals could be shown to capture gentrification dynamics before they fully manifest in conventional sociodemographic data, the importance of toponymic analysis in urban contexts would become all the more apparent.\nFinally, researchers in human-computer interaction could expand the scope of this research program. Qualitative analyses could add considerable depth to our understanding of how tourists, commuters, and prospective residents mobilize toponymic knowledge in the process of housing search practices, whether for short- or long-term rentals and home-buying. On the supply side, the same could be done for Airbnb hosts. Given the increasing professionalization of Airbnb hosting (Bosma, 2022; Dogru et al., 2020), the ways in which such practices vary across highly professionalized (and sometimes corporatized) Airbnb hosts compared with hosts who simply rent their spare rooms or apartments when they are away could merit attention as well.\nEthical Considerations\nData. Our data comes from Inside Airbnb, which describes itself as \u201ca mission driven project that provides data and advocacy about Airbnb\u2019s impact on residential communities.\u201d10 Only public snapshots from Airbnb are collected and analyzed, and obfuscation is present, to a certain extent, for location information on listings. Despite the public nature of our data, it is unreasonable to assume that users explicitly consent for their data to be collected and analyzed in this way. As is with most computational social science research conducted at scale, it is infeasible to obtain explicit user consent for large-scale datasets such as ours (Buchanan, 2017). Here, we believe that the benefits of our work in illuminating the ways in which neighborhood dynamics are inscribed in toponymic practice outweigh its potential harms.\nLimitations\nWe interpret this paper as a proof-of-concept that relates theoretical perspectives from human geography and critical toponymy to NLP modeling, pointing towards numerous avenues for future research. In addition to the future work suggested above, our technical solutions could be improved in several ways. While our NER models achieved strong F1-scores, a larger annotated dataset would likely improve performance. Second, our results are specific to New York, and further work is required to determine to what extent they generalize to other cities. Third, we filtered out reviews and descriptions that were not estimated to be in English with a 0.95 or higher probability. Results might differ in sociologically substantial ways with a multilinugual approach. Fourth, the data we use is unevenly distributed across space, an issue that future work could address by incorporating spatial smoothing techniques."

Before detailing the categories, there are three universal ground rules for determining annotations:\n\u2022 Always omit determiners from noun phrases.\n\u2013 i.e., tag Metropolitan Museum of Art, not The Metropolitan Museum of Art; grocery stores instead of a few grocery stores; corner of 29th and 6th instead of the corner of 29th and 6th. Inconsistency with this will harm model performance.\n\u2022 If a noun phrase contains an adjective, omit the adjective unless it is an essential part of the noun phrase.\n\u2013 \u201cEssential\u201d introduces a bit of interpretation, but here are some guidelines: tag \u201cMexican restaurant,\u201d \u201cgrocery store\u201d, or \u201ccocktail bar\u201d, but omit the adjectives in phrases like \u201cnice restaurants,\u201d \u201c24/7 stores\u201d, or \u201cfun bar\u201d.\n\u2022 Do not tag any references to the interior of the Airbnb unit itself.\n\u2013 We have a category, HOST_BUILDING, which is for references to certain building features, but we don\u2019t want to tag things like bathroom attached to the bedroom, or anything else *inside* of the apartment.\nAnnotation Categories. There are 11 categories that start with the prefix TN. This stands for toponym, and it means that the reference to a location or spatial relationship involves directly referencing a specific identity by name. Walgreens, the Hudson River, The Whitney Museum, Central Park, 5th Avenue, NYU, and Brooklyn are all toponyms. TN categories are listed below, in no particular order:\n\u2022 TN:NEIGHBORHOOD\n\u2013 These should be mostly captured automatically by our list of neighborhood names, but things like misspellings might require human annotation.\n\u2013 If the text modifies the neighborhood with words like downtown/uptown or upper/lower, include those words in the description (i.e., Downtown Flushing, Lower Manhattan should be tagged as TN:NEIGHBORHOOD)\n\u2022 TN:STATION\n\u2013 TN:STATION refers specifically to specific transit stations (e.g., the Bergen 2/3 stop, MyrtleWilloughby Station, Grand Central Station)\n\u2013 References to subway, bus, ferry lines without mentioning a specific stop (e.g., the 6 train) should be tagged as TRANSIT, not TN:STATION\n\u2013 Should include well known stations that could potentially be TN:TOURIST_ATTR (e.g. Grand Central) and train stations (e.g. Penn Station)\n\u2022 TN:CITY\n\u2013 This will almost always be New York City, NYC, New York/NY (when clearly referencing the city and not the state)\n\u2022 TN:BOROUGH\n\u2013 Any reference to a borough. These should mostly be automated, but some misspellings or shorthands (e.g., BK for Brooklyn) may need to be done by hand\n\u2022 TN:PARK\n\u2013 Any named park: Central Park, Prospect Park, Greenwood, etc. Some neighborhoods in NYC have the word Park in them (e.g., Ozone Park), so make sure to double check if you are unsure.\n\u2022 TN:SCHOOL\n\u2013 These will mostly be colleges and universities\u2014Columbia, NYU, Fordham, CUNY, etc.\u2014though references to other schools should also be marked with this.\n\u2022 TN:TOURIST_ATTR\n\u2013 Primarily museums, performance venues, and landmarks (Statue of Liberty). Other things that could be considered tourist attractions, such as universities or famous stores, should be marked in those respective categories rather than the more general TOURIST_ATTR.\n\u2013 Ambigious cases that should be tagged here:\n* The Highline * Apollo Theater, etc. * All botanical gardens and zoos\n\u2022 TN:STREET\n\u2013 Street names; street corners (e.g., \u201c29th and 5th Ave\u201d should be split up (\u201c29th\u201d and \u201c5th Ave\u201d as separate street names)\n\u2013 Include \u201csquare\u201d and \u201cSq.\u201d \u2013 Other ambiguous cases that should be tagged here include Columbus Circle.\n\u2022 TN:BUSINESS\n\u2013 Any named business: CVS, Walgreens, Domino\u2019s, Macy\u2019s etc.\n\u2022 TN:OTHER\n\u2013 This is a grab-bag category.\n\u2013 Zip codes\n\u2022 TN:AIRPORT\n\u2013 Any named reference to JFK, LGA, EWR, or other airports\n\u2022 TN:REGION\n\u2013 Any toponymic area larger than a city: counties, subregions (\u201cThe Hamptons\u201d), states, countries \u2013 \u201cNY\u201d can be ambiguous as to the city or the state; use judgment according to sentence of context\n\u2022 TN:BEACH\n\u2013 Any toponymic beach. The difficulty here is that many beaches also share a name with the neighborhood. The coder will have to use judgment to determine whether it is the beach itself or the neighborhood being referenced. We expect the majority of usages to refer to the beach\n\u2022 TN:BRIDGE_TUNNEL\n\u2013 Any toponymic reference to bridges and tunnels (e.g., Holland Tunnel, Williamsburg Bridge).

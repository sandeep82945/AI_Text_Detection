    "abstractText": "Most events in the world receive at most brief coverage by the news media. Occasionally, however, an event will trigger a media storm, with voluminous and widespread coverage lasting for weeks instead of days. In this work, we develop and apply a pairwise article similarity model, allowing us to identify story clusters in corpora covering local and national online news, and thereby create a comprehensive corpus of media storms over a nearly two year period. Using this corpus, we investigate media storms at a new level of granularity, allowing us to validate claims about storm evolution and topical distribution, and provide empirical support for previously hypothesized patterns of influence of storms on media coverage and intermedia agenda setting.",

            "text": "On March 9, 2021 jury selection began in the trial of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Over the next month and a half, details of the case such as calls for delay, jury selection, presentation of evidence, and an eventual guilty verdict were covered scrupulously by the media\u2014peaking in coverage 48 days after the story first broke (see Figure 1). This type of enduring and high volume coverage is a prime example of a media storm. In this paper, we construct a comprehensive corpus of media storms from nearly two years of coverage, which we use to study the nature and dynamics of this particularly influential media event type.\nCitizens are exposed to major news stories such as these on a daily basis, and these news events have been shown to influence public discussion and debate (Walgrave et al., 2017; McCombs and Shaw, 1972; King et al., 2017; Langer and Gruber, 2021). Furthermore, decades of scholarship have attempted to characterize this type of coverage under a range of theoretical definitions such as media hypes, political waves, and news waves (Wien and\nElmelund-Pr\u00e6stek\u00e6r, 2009; Wolfsfeld and Sheafer, 2006; Kepplinger and Habermeier, 1995). We build especially on the work of Boydstun et al. (2014), who approach this topic by synthesizing previous theoretical definitions under the term media storms, focusing on coverage so prominent that media consumers can\u2019t help but know about it. While prior research has theorized about their mechanisms, there has been limited quantitative analysis of the conditions in which storms emerge, and the effects that they have on the news ecosystem.\nThrough the creation of a state-of-the-art news article similarity model, we identify story clusters from a corpus of over 4 million news articles. Within this larger dataset, we identify 98 media storms over a period of 21 months; while small in number, these storms alone comprise 20,331 articles in our data, and were covered widely in 417 mainstream, conspiratorial, political, and local news outlets. The diversity and magnitude of our media storms provide a unique opportunity to test specific hypothesis from Media and Communications theory.\nIn brief, this work makes the following contributions: We create a state-of-the-art article embedding model enabling fast and accurate comparison of billions of news article pairs, and use it to create\nand publicly release a new dataset of story clusters, augmenting a combination of existing news datasets representing almost two years of coverage (\u00a73). Working at a more fine grained level of analysis than was previously possible, we then validate and strengthen previous observations about the temporal dynamics (\u00a74) and topical composition (\u00a75) of media storms. Finally, we provide evidence about the role of media storms in regard to intermedia agenda setting and gatekeeping patterns amongst news outlets (\u00a76).\nGiven the influence of media storms and other news on democratic debate and public discourse (Walgrave et al., 2017; King et al., 2017), our findings also offer a step towards answering the question of which actors get to decide what information becomes impossible to ignore. Furthermore, the introduction of our model allows researchers to trace the evolution of single stories and events over time, enabling a number of new downstream analyses in the agenda setting and framing space.

            "text": "Defining Media Storms A number of definitions have been employed to characterize explosive and long-lasting stories that arise in the news ecosystem (Vasterman, 2018). Kepplinger and Habermeier (1995) present the idea of news waves, which are started by a key event and trigger increased coverage of similar events. Vasterman (2005) builds off of the news wave phenomenon, introducing media hypes. Whereas news waves are identified based on an increase in coverage relative to the number of events, media hypes are defined by a self-reinforcing process of news production resulting in an increased number of articles pertaining to a single issue. Boydstun et al. (2014)\u2019s media storm abstracts the descriptive claims of prior theories while relaxing assumptions about the mechanisms behind them. Theoretically, media storms are when the media ecosystem goes into \u201cstorm mode\u201d, shifting from routine coverage to an intensive focus on a particular event, issue, or topic over a period of time (Hardy, 2018).\nMechanisms Two primary mechanisms have been identified to explain the development of media storms. First, media storms may be caused by a lowering of the gatekeeping threshold (Kep-\nplinger and Habermeier, 1995; Brosius and Eps, 1995; Hardy, 2018; Wolfsfeld and Sheafer, 2006). After an event or issue has received extensive coverage at a given outlet, it is seen as more newsworthy by reporters and editors at that same outlet, who will therefore be more likely to write or publish additional coverage of it. This notion is supported by evidence that organizations tend to operate with a centralized, top down structure in the wake of large events, which implies that certain trigger events cause a large spike in follow up coverage and a subsequent media storm (Hardy, 2018; Wien and Elmelund-Pr\u00e6stek\u00e6r, 2009).\nWhile the gatekeeping threshold primarily concerns within-outlet reporting practices, the intermedia agenda setting hypothesis describes the emulation of coverage between outlets. When outlets see that a story has risen to prominence in other outlets, they may be incentivized to shift their own coverage (Boydstun et al., 2014; Hardy, 2018; Vliegenthart and Walgrave, 2008; Anderson, 2010; Vargo and Guo, 2017). This incentivization may be especially true for outlets which feel that their principal reporting domains are being encroached upon (Boydstun et al., 2014)."

Here, we make use of the dataset from the SemEval task on news article similarity (Chen et al., 2022), which contains labels for 4,950 pairs of news articles rated for similarity.1 Our goal was to create an accurate model that could scale to millions of articles. To do so, we fit a bi-encoder MPNet model initialized with all-mpnet-base-v2 parameters (Song et al., 2020).2 We fine-tuned this model by minimizing mean squared error between the cosine similarity of article pairs embedded by the model and the corresponding human similarity ratings.\nOur approach incorporates multiple techniques from models submitted to the SemEval competition (Chen et al., 2022). To ensure scalability, we used a bi-encoder approach; at interference time, this allows us to precompute all n article embeddings (O(n)), rather than using a cross-encoder, (as was used by the top performing model in the competition, Xu et al., 2022), which requires O(n2) to encode and evaluate all pairs. The model from Wangsadirdja et al. (2022) also used a bi-encoder approach but we simplified and streamlined their method for better scalability by discard the additional convolutional layers and the ensembling strategy used by these authors.\nInspired by Xu et al. (2022), we concatenate the first 288 tokens of each article with the last 96 tokens, in order to include information from both the head and tail of each article. Of the 4,950 article pairs available, 1,791 were English-English pairs and the remaining 3,159 were non-English.

The resulting pairwise similarity matrix of all article pairs over our threshold forms a graph, and our story clusters are the connected components of this graph.\n3Averaging over random seeds, our model achieves the highest mean correlation score, but would rank second due to how the competition scoring weights multiple entries."

Time series analyses of political rumors, misinformation, memes, and search keywords have found that attention around a given construct displays distinct patterns, typically rising to a peak and falling very quickly thereafter (Leskovec et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2018). Media storms, however, have been differentiated as having an explosive rise in coverage followed by relatively smooth, gradual changes (Boydstun et al., 2014).\nTo elucidate the general temporal dynamics of media storms, Figure 3 (top) displays the average volume of coverage over time across all 98 storms.\nThis average series quickly rises to prominence within three days, declines steadily until day 10, and diminishes far more gradually after that. A similar trend is observed for the number of unique US states represented by the outlets involved in a storm\u2019s coverage (Figure 3, bottom).\nTemporal statistics of media storms provide support for previous findings that they are both explosive and long-lasting. The median day for a storm\u2019s peak coverage is day 4.5, and the most common day for peak coverage is the first day, followed by days 2\u20135.6 In other words, most storms peak almost immediately, demonstrating the explosiveness of their coverage. To show how long media storms linger in the press, we use the empirical CDF of storm duration, which is presented in Figure 4. Here, we find that the percentage of storms lasting for weeks of coverage is far higher for storms than non-storms.\nAlthough most storms have an early peak of coverage, we also identify heterogeneity in mediastorm development, with a significant fraction of stories having two distinct peaks or even peaking at the end of their respective time series. These late-peaking stories appear to relate to events that are inherently ongoing or can be anticipated.\nTo verify this qualitatively, we perform a manual review of storms peaking on or after day 15. Out of these 13 late-peak storms, eight cover stories with a clear anticipated peak event such as court cases, elections and bills passing through Congress. The remaining five storms pertain to ongoing coverage of COVID-19 and assault allegations made by Tara Reade during Joe Biden\u2019s campaign. This aligns\n6The distribution of peak timing and other properties of our media storms are included as plots in Appendix C.\nwith work correlating the temporal dynamics of the news with stories pertaining to different topics (Gei\u00df, 2018), and indicates a need for further research to understand how storms with different content develop.

            "text": "Examining media storms at the level of issues, Boydstun et al. (2014) hypothesized and found that media storms tend to be more skewed towards certain issues than overall media coverage, with the majority of storms being related to Government Operations, Defense, or International Affairs (which were also the most common issues in overall coverage, but to a much lesser degree).7 This observation also aligns with literature positing that stories with certain news values are more appealing to the media and therefore more likely to trigger storm-development mechanisms (Harcup and O\u2019Neill, 2017).\nTo test this theory at the level of media storms tied to specific events, we ran Latent Dirichlet Analysis (Blei et al., 2003) on our entire corpus of news articles using Mallet (McCallum, 2002). We set the number of topics to be 30, infer a distribution over topics for each article, and associate each article with its highest-scoring topic. Finally, we aggregate these topics across storm and non-storm articles.\nAs shown in Figure 5 and supplemental Figures 11 and 12 in Appendix C, we confirm the previous finding that media storms have a topic distribution which is far more skewed than the topic distribution for non-storm articles. In addition, we find that certain topics make up a much larger fraction of coverage for storms than non-storms. In particular, topics related to politics, natural disasters, and policing are overrepresented in storms, whereas topics related to sports, entertainment, and daily life are underrepresented. In contrast to Boydstun et al. (2014), however, we find that topics related to defense and international affairs are less common among storms compared to non-storms, as well as being less common overall, compared to other topics (see Figure 12 in Appendix C). This may relate in part to our use of a much wider set of media outlets, including many local news sources.\n7Boydstun et al. (2014) used 27 hand-coded issue areas from the Comparative Agendas Project.\nRegarding the topic skew of media storms, we hypothesize that this distinction may be a result of certain types of events lending themselves to ongoing and follow-up coverage. A topic like entertainment may contain more disparate one-off events, whereas legislation and disasters reflect events whose development and consequences can last for longer periods of time."

            "text": "Gatekeeping refers to the process of filtering or selecting what information to present out of the vast universe of possibilities (Shoemaker and Vos, 2009). One potential explanatory mechanisms for the emergence of media storms is a lowering of the gatekeeping threshold. According to this theory, once a particular topic, issue, or event has received a critical mass of coverage, it is seen as more newsworthy and will therefore receive even more coverage (Boydstun et al., 2014). At the news-outlet level, this effect can be explained by disruptions in publishing routines. Indeed, interview data finds that in extreme cases, news outlets may even reassign almost every journalist to a particular issue or event (Hardy, 2018).\nOf interest here is whether a surge in attention on a single story is correlated with a broader shift in the attention devoted to related stories. According to this framework, once the gatekeeping threshold is lowered, events are stitched together by the media to form a broader reporting agenda with even historical events being introduced back into the discourse (Kepplinger and Habermeier, 1995; Seguin, 2016; Baumgartner and Jones, 1993). It follows that if the gatekeeping threshold mechanism holds for our media storms, they should be accompanied by waves of additional topically related coverage.\nTo test this hypothesis empirically, we first identify a time period of 14 days before and after the first day of coverage of each storm. We then limit ourselves to only outlets that report on the media storm in question. For each day in our 29-day window, we then measure the mean percentage of coverage devoted to the topic associated with corresponding storm, averaged across all storms.8\nWhen including all articles, we find an increase of 1.6 percentage points from the mean pre-storm level to the maximum level during the storm (see Figure 6). If we exclude the articles associated with the media storm, and only consider others on the same topic, we find there is still an increase of 1.1 percentage points from the mean pre-storm topic level to the maximum post-storm level. Together, these suggest that media storms lead to increased attention to the broader issue they are part of, thereby disrupting normal publishing routines.\nPerhaps more surprisingly, we also see that at-\n8A storm\u2019s topic is defined as the topic with the highest concentration when summing topic distributions across all of the associated articles.\ntention to issues begins to rise before the start of associated storms. Some of this might be accounted for by early articles that were not properly matched to the story cluster, but a more compelling explanation is that coverage of an issue begins to rise early in anticipation of a particular event. Given that topics related to somewhat predictable events, such as court cases, are over-represented among storms (see Figure 5), this early rise may represent news organizations \u201cpriming the pump\u201d in advance of their coverage of the actual event."

            "text": "A second mechanism proposed to explain media storms is inter-media agenda setting (Boydstun et al., 2014; Hardy, 2018). According to this theory, reporting from one news outlet signals the importance of a given event or issue to other outlets (Vliegenthart and Walgrave, 2008).\nTo determine which outlets lead in storm coverage, we analyze the patterns of publishing on storms across outlets. To do so, we construct a weighted graph with outlets as nodes. For all outlets and storms, we find the first article each outlet publishes about a given storm. We then assign credit for influence to all outlets that had an article related to that storm in the preceding two days. The edge between outlet i and outlet j is thus the number of storms in which outlet i published in the two days preceding the first article from outlet j.\nUsing the 20 outlets with the most articles in our 98 storms (among those rated as reliable in the NELA data), Figure 7 shows the directed influ-\nence among these outlets, with node size mapping to the net influence of that outlet, considering all incoming and outgoing edges. This graph is consistent with the hypothesis that intermedia agenda setting is present as storms migrate through the media ecosystem. Overall, we find a rich network of connections, with no single outlet consistently publishing in advance of all others. Nevertheless, a few\noutlets do appear most prominently in this analysis, including nonprofits (PBS, NPR), and digital-only platforms like Yahoo News.\nFigure 8 presents a similar analysis at the level of different parts of the media ecosystem. Once again, we see a clear distinction that aligns with an intermedia agenda setting mechanism for storm development. In particular, reliable news appears to be highly influential on local and on less-reliable national news. The opposite is true of unreliable news, which has weak influence relationships to all outlet types. One finding of particular interest is that local news is disproportionately influenced by reliable news but influences mixed and unreliable news disproportionately. The discovery of this heterogeneity in influence signals a need for more research on the relationship between local coverage and national coverage of varying types."

            "text": "When considered in the context of prior work, our results have implications for the media\u2019s effect on public and congressional agendas. In their original paper, Boydstun et al. (2014) find that Google queries corresponding to a given event spike more during media storms than during coverage of similar non-storm stories. Furthermore Walgrave et al. (2017) find that news stories exert a stronger influence over the congressional agenda when these\nstories are part of a media storm. By characterizing the temporal dynamics, topical skew, and lead-lag relationships associated with media storms at the level of events, we give context for what types of stories have a larger agenda setting effect and where these stories originate from.\nAlthough our analysis of media storms revealed a somewhat different distribution of topics than the hand-coded analysis of news headlines in Boydstun et al. (2014), overall our characterization of storms broadly matches theirs. Some events, such as accusations of sexual assault against Joe Biden, trigger media storms involving hundreds of news articles across dozens of outlets. Others, such as airlines cancelling flights due to staffing shortages, have a much smaller footprint, but still persist in the news cycle for more than a week.\nWhile some storms, (such as the trial of Derek Chauvin), peak weeks after they begin, the typical storm follows a pattern of explosive coverage (peaking within the first few days), followed by a gradual decline in attention. Moreover, this initial increase in coverage is accompanied by, and sometimes even anticipated by, an increase in attention to the broader issue area that the storm is part of (e.g., policing, natural disasters, etc.). All of these findings point to the operation of underlying mechanisms governing news production, with limited resources available within each news outlet.\nBeyond the results in this paper, the methodology, model, and dataset we contribute open the door for future research on media storms. One important direction is the causal investigation of media influence. For example, identification of matched pairs of media storms with comparable non-storms would allow for more direct testing of the key conditions which cause stories to gain traction. Such a study is difficult because many media storms may have no comparable counterfactual non-storm, and the relevant features needed to match pairs may be unobserved. Unanticipated real world events (e.g. natural disasters) may also provide natural experiments to study the media conditions in which storm are most likely to develop, and could be compared to storms based around events which can be anticipated. Alternatively, follow up studies could investigate how interactions between traditional media, social media, and political elites influence the trajectory of media storms.\nIn addition to the estimation of larger and more diverse diffusion networks, future work could also\nconnect these results with the literature on framing and agenda setting. Our analysis finds that unreliable media frequently lags behind other media sources; however, it is unclear why this is the case. Past work has hypothesized that alternative media frequently frames itself in opposition to the mainstream, revealing the \u201ctruth\u201d that the mainstream is \u201cunwilling\u201d to say (Andersen et al., 2023; Holt et al., 2019). If the framing of outlets\u2019 coverage can be connected to patterns of diffusion, this would result in a far more complete picture of why media outlets report what they report when they do.\nFinally, future work may address the limitations of our news similarity model and article matching pipeline. In terms of efficiency, a faster article matching approach would allow for analysis of the much larger, global media ecosystem. In terms of accuracy, our model\u2019s performance is typically lower on articles generated from templates such as COVID-19 trackers. A more sophisticated iteration would reliably distinguish between articles about different events in spite of their high textual similarity."

Taken together, our results distinguish media storms as a phenomenon with distinct temporal and topical characteristics. Furthermore, they indicate that some news outlets and categories of news are seemingly more influential than others.

However, there are a number of notable limitations to our approach as well as directions for future research.\nOne initial limitation in our approach comes from our reliance on three existing datasets of news articles. These datasets only cover a 21 month overlapping period and include a variety of outlets, some of which are based outside the United States. Given this composition of outlets, our data is likely not representative of any one news ecosystem but rather captures a broad sample of the U.S. national and local media outlets with some international coverage included.\nIn addition, our three news datasets were originally collected from RSS feeds, meaning that we have limited knowledge on the completeness of coverage. While RSS feeds typically mirror the online feed of news organizations, outlets which push only a fraction of coverage to their feed may interfere with the accuracy of our results. Despite these potential issues, we find that the duration and temporal patterns of our identified media storms align with what is expected given prior literature.\nIn terms of identifying storms, one limitation in our work is the scalability of our clustering pipeline. To avoid computing pairwise similarity among n2 pairs for millions of articles, our current approach considers pairwise similarity between all articles with named entity pairs having under 20,000 occurrences, restricted to those article pairs that are published less than eight days apart. While larger events can be identified through links between pairs of articles with different, less common named entities, our cutoff of 20,000 might unintentionally exclude some of the largest news storms. Most of the entities that were removed correspond to prominent politicians or organizations (e.g., Joe Biden, the FBI, etc.). However, one notable exception is that our dataset does not include a media storm specifically about the death of George Floyd, as this name was mentioned in more than 80,000 articles in our full dataset, and was therefore removed before forming story clusters.\nWhen it comes to analyzing our identified media storms, our evidence has important limitations as well. Our results on the development of media storms are merely correlational and fail to as-\nsess what causes media storms. Given the selfreferential nature of the news production process (Kepplinger and Habermeier, 1995), these causal mechanisms are incredibly difficult to locate. As such, large scale descriptive results still represent an important step in extending the current state of the literature."

            "text": "The SemEval task on news article similarity (Chen et al., 2022) was a multilingual challenge, where teams were given access to pairs of news articles rated in terms of multiple types of similarity (e.g., temporal, geographic, tone) on a scale of 1 to 4. We relied on the \u201coverall\u201d similarity judgements, and rescaled the similarity scores to [0, 1].\nThe top-performing model in the competition (Xu et al., 2022) used a cross-encoder, in which a model was trained using pairs of article texts given to the model simultaneously. Because such an approach does not scale to rating the similarity of millions of articles, we opted to use a more efficient bi-encoder (as used by other submissions, such as Wangsadirdja et al., 2022), in which a model is trained to usefully embed articles, such that the similarity of embeddings can then be quickly computed.\nIn developing our model, we performed an ablation study to evaluate the effectiveness of various data augmentation decisions. Taking inspiration from (Xu et al., 2022)\u2019s approach, we experimented with translation of training data into English as well as various concatenation of the head and tail of news articles. Five-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the efficacy of these approaches, without making any use of the test data. When using translated data, only the English article pairs from a given fold were used for evaluation.\nAs shown in Table 3, both methods appear to have a minimal effect on the performance of our model. Despite this null result, we still use translated data and a combination of 288 head tokens and 96 tail tokens. This choice is made because both augmentation strategies were effective in Xu et al. (2022), which was the top-ranked model when evaluated on the SemEval English-only test set."

            "text": "In order to reduce the number of pairwise article similarity comparisons needed to augment our dataset of over 4 million articles, we first applied a named entity filter. Named entities were extracted from each article using the named entity recognition pipeline in spaCy\u2019s en_core_web_md model.9\nAfter identifying these entities, we kept only those entities corresponding to an Organization, Event, Person, Work of Art, or Product, as entities\n9https://spacy.io/models/en\nof other types were more likely to be associated with an unreasonably large number of articles. For computational reasons, entities with over 20,000 associated news articles were also removed. This resulted in the exclusion of 113 entities, which left 2,614,176 distinct entities remaining with at least two associated articles. Finally, we created an inverted index between each entity and its corresponding articles. This index was used to determine which pairs of articles had at least one entity in common and were thus designated as eligible for comparison using our pairwise similarity model.\nWhile entities such as \u201cFDA\u201d, \u201cBiden\u201d, and \u201cTrump\u201d were among the removed entities, we found multiple media storms with coverage relating to these entities and mentioning them in the article text. This suggests that many media storms are identifiable with entities which are less common across all articles and more specific to the associated event. For completeness, we include the full list of excluded entities in the replication code associated with this project.\nWhen embedding articles using our similarity model, we merged the first 288 tokens of each article including the title with the last 96 tokens, as discussed in Appendix A. As shown in Figure 9 this resulted in the majority of articles being truncated. This effect was only modest, however, with the median article length being reduced from 467 words to 317 words when identifying words by splitting on whitespace in the article text. We also experimented with models having longer context windows but found that this produced inferior results in pilot experiments."

            "text": "Figure 10 shows some additional plots describing the distribution of media storms, in terms of total\narticle count, peak day of storm coverage, storm duration in days, and percentage of coverage in national outlets (as opposed to local). Most storms are primarily national, but with a small number that are almost entirely local. Similarly, there is a long tail of storms in terms of duration, peak day, and total volume, with the largest storms comprising over 1,000 articles.\nFigures 11 and 12 show the individual average topic distributions for both storms and non-storms as a complement to Figure 5 in the main paper. As can be seen, the distribution of storm topics is more skewed, and shows considerable difference in relative topic rankings."

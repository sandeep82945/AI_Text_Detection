    "abstractText": "In the era of widespread dissemination through social media, the task of rumor detection plays a pivotal role in establishing a trustworthy and reliable information environment. Nonetheless, existing research on rumor detection confronts several challenges: the limited expressive power of text encoding sequences, difficulties in domain knowledge coverage and effective information extraction with knowledge graph-based methods, and insufficient mining of semantic structural information. To address these issues, we propose a Crowd Intelligence and ChatGPT-Assisted Network(CICAN) for rumor classification. Specifically, we present a crowd intelligence-based semantic feature learning module to capture textual content\u2019s sequential and hierarchical features. Then, we design a knowledge-based semantic structural mining module that leverages ChatGPT for knowledge enhancement. Finally, we construct an entity-sentence heterogeneous graph and design Entity-Aware Heterogeneous Attention to integrate diverse structural information metapaths effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that CICAN achieves performance improvement in rumor detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and rationality of using large language models as auxiliary tools.",

            "text": "In recent years, the number of rumors posted on the Internet has increased significantly, and the harm of rumors is that they may cause panic and unnecessary actions, undermine social stability and trust, and negatively affect individuals, organizations, and society (Lin et al., 2021). Unlike traditional media channels, information on social networks has the characteristics of fast dissemination and wide coverage, leading to a large amount of information that cannot be verified in real-time (Khan\n\u2217* Corresponding author This work is done when Chang Yang visited Tianjin University for exchange.\net al., 2021; Vosoughi et al., 2018). In response to this problem, rumor detection methods based on crowd intelligence have attracted much attention. Crowd intelligence means social media users spread and interpret information by sharing personal opinions positions, questioning, and providing evidence (Phan et al., 2023). We realize that rumors are the result of the interaction between social media and swarm intelligence, a phenomenon of information dissemination among groups. That is, the characteristics of swarm intelligence are the fundamental reason why rumor detection becomes more complicated. From the perspective of crowd intelligence, we redefine rumors based on existing viewpoints (Phan et al., 2023; Zubiaga et al., 2018; Doan et al., 2011): the Rumor is an influential but unverified statement widely disseminated on social networks and other channels through people\u2019s collective participation and information interaction. Social media users usually share their views on the veracity of rumors through collective, subjective understanding (Tolmie et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2018), which may help reveal the truth behind the rumors. Therefore, the crowd\u2019s cognitive mechanism for rumors has important guiding significance for rumor detection, especially the detection method based on crowd intelligence. However, there are still some problems in effectively utilizing crowd intelligence in rumor detection:\n1) Due to the complexity and irregularity of information on social networks, current research methods have certain limitations in extracting deep semantic features. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for this purpose. Still, their max-pooling operations can lead to loss of detail and positional information, limiting the expressive power of text-encoded sequences. Therefore, improving the model\u2019s ability to detect deep semantic features while preserving the relationship between low and high-level features is crucial for optimal performance.\n2) The method (Wei et al., 2019; Tchakount\u00e9 et al., 2020) based on Crowd Intelligence has been proven effective in identifying information on social networks. Since information on social networks is noisy, it is crucial to introduce additional knowledge to supplement semantic information. However, current primary supplement semantic information methods, such as knowledge graphs, face challenges in extracting information effectively. Therefore, it is essential to introduce external knowledge effectively. 3) Fully mining the semantic structure information in the text is crucial for rumor detection, and there are currently two main problems to be solved. First, the study (Zhu et al., 2022) found that insufficient learning of entity information will cause entity bias and affect the model\u2019s generalization to future data. Second, important information is usually distributed in various text positions rather than concentrated in a specific position, which increases the difficulty of extracting complex long-distance semantically dependent features. Efficiently constructing heterogeneous graphs and selecting appropriate meta-paths to integrate semantic structure information are the keys to addressing these issues. Based on the above challenges and shortcomings, this paper proposes Crowd Intelligence and ChatGPT-Assisted Network(CICAN) that uses crowd intelligence and introduces a large language model as an auxiliary tool, combining semantic content and structure information for rumor detection. The model includes the Crowd Intelligencebased Semantic Feature Learning Module (CIS) and the Knowledge-based Semantic Structure Mining Module (KSS). First, we propose a contextaware semantic encoder and a multi-granularity feature extractor for extracting semantic content features, leveraging TweetBERT to enhance the model\u2019s ability to handle semantic and contextual relevance, and combining BiLSTM and capsule networks for sequential and hierarchical feature learning. Then, by leveraging ChatGPT to extract refined and structured knowledge from the raw data, we construct the Entity-Sentence heterogeneous graph containing two types of nodes and design a new hierarchical attention mechanism to enhance the model\u2019s ability to capture complex relationships. Our main contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 Our proposed rumor detection model (CICAN) extracts semantic content and semantic structure features by introducing crowd in-\ntelligence and adequate external knowledge. Furthermore, we redefine rumors based on crowd intelligence and suggest meaningful future research directions in the field of rumor detection.\n\u2022 We apply large language models(LLM) to rumor detection for the first time, using ChatGPT as an auxiliary means for text enhancement, entity linking, and text conceptualization, and demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the approach.\n\u2022 Our experiments on two real-world datasets show that our method is highly effective and outperforms the baseline approach. Our unique design has substantially enhanced the task of rumor detection."

            "text": "At present, the entry point of rumor detection work mainly focuses on the content characteristics of social posts (Phan et al., 2023) because social posts carry crowd intelligence, which can be gathered in their creation, interaction, and dissemination. Traditional methods are mainly based on feature engineering (Castillo et al., 2011; Lim et al., 2017; Rayana and Akoglu, 2015; Al-Ghadir et al., 2021), using user opinions on social media platforms and feature information of social networks to extract features and use classifiers to detect rumors manually. However, the complexity of social media data is mainly reflected in the diversity of content, topics, and styles. In contrast, deep learning-based methods can automatically learn representations of features. Existing studies (Ma et al., 2016; Asghar et al., 2021; Liu and Wu, 2018; Yu et al., 2017) mostly use CNN to extract key features from the text content of related posts. However, the max pooling operation of CNN comes at the cost of losing the precise encoding of object locations (Mazzia et al., 2021). To address this issue, Sabour et al. (2017) introduced capsule networks, which use vector outputs and the \"routing-by-agreement\" algorithm to retain position information and mine features from various perspectives. Capsule networks have proven effective in text classification tasks (Zhao et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019). By incorporating capsule networks into NLP, we can capture different types of semantic information,\nrepresenting word relationships, syntactic structures, and similar word characteristics."

Existing research in rumor detection has primarily focused on incorporating external knowledge, such as knowledge graphs. CompareNet (Hu et al., 2021) captures content-knowledge consistency by comparing contextual entity representations with knowledgebased ones. The multimodal knowledge-aware event memory network (MKEMN) (Zhang et al., 2019) integrates knowledge graphs and memory networks, considering both text and multimedia data to detect rumors. DDGCN (Sun et al., 2022) dynamically models message spreading and background knowledge from knowledge graphs in a unified framework. However, the complexity and informality of social network information pose challenges for knowledge graph-based methods to extract knowledge information in specific research fields effectively.\nRecently, large-scale language models, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing tasks, capable of extracting accurate and rich features beyond traditional methods (Feng et al., 2023). Therefore, utilizing ChatGPT as an auxiliary tool to improve the model\u2019s performance has become a promising trend."

All the learnable parameters of the model are denoted as \u03b8. The class label Y = {T, F,N,U} represents the four categories: T (true rumor), F (false rumor), N (non-rumor), and U (unverified rumor). The semantic content information V comprises a collection of event sentences, including source tweets and comments. For each event X = {x, c1, c2, ..., cp} , where x represents the source tweet, ci represents the comment corresponding to the source tweet, and p is the maximum number of comments. To capture the semantic structure information, we construct the entity-sentence heterogeneous graph denoted as GS_Ei = (V S_E i , E S_E i ), where V S_E i and E S_E i represent the nodes and edges in the graph, respectively. V S_Ei is composed of a series of sentences from the event X(source tweet, comments) along with reinforced entity nodes E\u2032t.

            "text": "The diverse nature and the challenge of discerning truth from falsehood in the discourse on social networks make it difficult to extract complex semantic content features for rumor detection from the massive amount of information. To address this issue, we design a contextual semantic encoder and multigranularity feature extractor. Recent experiment\n(Farinneya et al., 2021) shows that TweetBERT performs well in identifying rumors on social media. TweetBERT (Qudar and Mago, 2020) is a pre-trained language model explicitly tailored for tweets, which is trained on a large corpus of tweet data, enabling it to capture nuances and essential features in tweets effectively. Inspired by this, we employ TweetBERT as the contextual semantic encoder to obtain the word embedding of each text sequence as HTB = [HTB0 , H TB 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , HTBp ] for enhancing the model\u2019s ability to handle semantic and contextual relevance.\nIn addition, we also combine BiLSTM and capsule network as the multi-granularity feature extractor for text sequential and hierarchical feature learning. Specifically, BiLSTM is a recurrent neural network structure that can efficiently process sequential information. We obtain the hidden state representation HBiLSTM\ni \u2208 Rs\u00d72h by concatenat-\ning the output of BiLSTM,\nHBiLSTMi = [LSTM( \u2212\u2192 H i), LSTM( \u2190\u2212 H i)] (1)\nwhere 2h is the hidden state dimension of BiLSTM, and s is the sequence length. For hierarchical feature learning, we use a 1D convolutional layer with a convolution kernel size of k and the number of convolution kernels of k_num to extract n-gram features at different positions in the sentence, ui = Conv(HBiLSTMi ) \u2208 R(s\u2212k+1)\u00d7k_num, which can be regarded as the primary capsules with a quantity of (s\u2212 k+1) and a dimension of k_num, and use\n\"squashing \" function:\nui = Squash(ui) = ||ui|| 1 + ||ui||2 ui ||ui|| (2)\nThen, the prediction vector of the primary capsule ui is obtained by projection, u\u0302i = W t\ni ui, u\u0302i \u2208 Rcin\u00d7(s\u2212k+1)\u00d7cdim , where W ti is the transformation matrix, the number of higher-level capsules is cin, and the dimension of the capsules is cdim. Next, we use the dynamic routing mechanism to generate prediction vectors for higher-level capsules based on the primary capsules. The higherlevel capsule vk is the sum of prediction vector in primary capsule u\u0302k|i and coupling coefficient ck|i.\nvk = \u2211 k ck|i \u00b7 u\u0302k|i (3)\nck|i = softmax(bk|i) (4)\nwhere bk|i is initialized to 0 and updates in each iteration bk|i = bk|i + u\u0302k|i \u2217 vk, ck|i is determined by the iterative dynamic routing process. Finally, through r rounds of dynamic routing iterations, we get the final output of the capsule network V = [v0, v1, ..., vp] , vk \u2208 Rcin\u00d7cdim , which represents the semantic content information of the event."

As shown in Figure 2.\nChatGPT-based Knowledge Extraction: To deal with informal texts on social networks, including abbreviations, misspellings, and spoken language, etc., we use ChatGPT to introduce external knowledge effectively. First, we process the raw texts using ChatGPT to build a corrected set of texts X \u2032i = {c\u20320, c\u20321, c\u20322, ..., c\u2032p}. We design task-specific prompts that aim to guide the understanding process of ChatGPT better. As shown in Prompt 1 of Appendix C. Then, we utilize ChatGPT to extract entities and concept information from the enhanced text via the \u201cisA\u201d relation, and the prompt used is shown in Prompt 2 of Appendix C. For a source tweet c0 \u2208 Rn\u00d7d of length n, entities can be represented as Et \u2208 Rm\u00d7d, concepts can be represented as Ct \u2208 Rm\u00d7k\u00d7d, m represents the maximum number of entities, and k represents the maximum number of concepts corresponding to each entity. Finally, we design the Context-based Entity Enhancement method. Current research work (Zhang et al., 2019) mainly focuses on modeling the attention mechanism between concepts and entities but does not fully consider the interrelationship between concepts and sentences. In fact, each concept can be regarded as a semantic interpretation of the entity, which may have different importance in different contexts. Therefore, we calculate the similarity between the concept Cjt corresponding to the entity and the sentence representation c0 to determine the importance of the concept for the context. By adding the calculation results to the original entity representation Et, we obtain the enhanced entity representation.\nE\u2032t = Et + k\u2211 j=1 softmax(c0 \u00b7 Cjt ) \u00b7 C j t (5)\nEntity-Aware Hierarchical Attention: To\nbetter capture the long-distance semantic dependencies and complex structural information of sentences, we construct the entity-sentence heterogeneous graph with enhanced sentence nodes X \u2032 = {c\u20320, c\u20321, c\u20322, . . . , c\u2032n} and entity nodes E\u2032t = {e\u20320, e\u20321, e\u20322, . . . , e\u2032m}. The graph contains two metapaths: Entity-Sentence-Entity (ESE) considers the relationship between different entities in a sentence, and Sentence-Entity-Sentence (SES) reflects the relationship between other sentences containing the same entity. Inspired by Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (Wang et al., 2019), the node-level attention mechanism is introduced to capture the information interaction between nodes and obtain richer feature representations. To align the feature spaces of sentence nodes c\u2032i and entity nodes e \u2032 i, transformation matrices Wc and We are applied to project the features of these distinct node types into a unified feature space. ci \u2032 = Wc \u2032T \u00b7ci\u2032, ei\u2032 = We\u2032T \u00b7ei\u2032. Then, the sentence attention and entity attention are respectively calculated for entity nodes with ESE meta-path structure and sentence nodes with SES meta-path structure, which can be expressed as:\n\u03b2\u2032ji = exp(\u03b1(aTe \u00b7 [e\u2032j ; e\u2032i]))\u2211\nk\u2208Nej exp(\u03b1(aTe \u00b7 [e\u2032j ; e\u2032k]))\n(6)\n\u03b1\u2032ji = exp(\u03b1(aTs \u00b7 [c\u2032j ; c\u2032i]))\u2211\nk\u2208Ncj exp(\u03b1(aTs \u00b7 [c\u2032j ; c\u2032k]))\n(7)\nwhere ci and cj represent a node with a SES structure, ei and ej represents a node with a ESE structure. ae, as are learned parameters, \u03b1 is the nonlinear activation function LeakyReLU (Xu et al., 2015). To capture multiple representations from different relations, a multi-head paradigm similar to multi-head attention is adopted, and the following output feature representation is obtained:\nc\u2032\u2032j = K\n|| k=1 \u03c3  \u2211 i\u2208N(c\u2032j) \u03b1kjic \u2032 i  (8)\ne\u2032\u2032j = K\n|| k=1 \u03c3  \u2211 i\u2208N(e\u2032j) \u03b2kjie \u2032 i  (9) where c\u2032\u2032j represents the feature representation that c\u2032j learned from the SES meta-path, e \u2032\u2032 j represents the feature representation that e\u2032j learned from the\nESE meta-path, k represents the number of attention heads.\nDifferent from the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network, We use co-attention (Lu et al., 2016) to automatically learn the independence of meta-paths and the synergy between different metapaths, enabling more accurate heterogeneous fusion. First calculate the affinity matrix of e\u2032\u2032j and c \u2032\u2032 j : Ces = tanh(e \u2032\u2032T j Wesc \u2032\u2032 j ). where Wes is a learnable parameter. Then, Ces is sent to the network as a feature, and the attention maps of entity features and sentence features are learned as follows:\nHs = tanh(Wsc \u2032\u2032 j + (Wee \u2032\u2032 j )C T es) (10)\n\u03b1s = softmax(W T S Hs) (11)\nHe = tanh(Wee \u2032\u2032 j + (Wsc \u2032\u2032 j )Ces) (12)\n\u03b1e = softmax(W T EHe) (13)\nwhere Ws,We,WS ,WE represent the learnable parameters, \u03b1s and \u03b1e represent the attention weights of sentence features c\u2032\u2032j and entity features e\u2032\u2032j , as the importance of each meta-path. With the learned weights as coefficients, we can fuse meta-paths zj = \u03b1sc\u2032\u2032j + \u03b1ee \u2032\u2032 j . Finally, we use cascading to integrate semantic content features V = {v0, v1, . . . , vp} and semantic structure features Z = {z0, z1, . . . , zp} into a unified representation, and output accuracy prediction through a multilayer perceptron:\ny\u0302 = softmax(W [V ;Z] + b) (14)\nwhere W is a learnable parameter and b represents a bias."

We use the KMGCN-NoVisual model (which excludes visual information) for a fair comparison. 7) DDGCN (Sun et al., 2022): This model uses Graph Convolutional Networks to model two types of structural information, including the content information in the propagation and the conceptual information of the knowledge graph."

The semantic content-based models PPC and dEFEND neglect deep semantic features and structural information. At the same time, we propose a method combining BiLSTM and capsule network, which can extract higher-level semantic information and capture part-whole relationships. Regarding models utilizing semantic structure information, the tree structure model RvNN exhibits slightly inferior performance due to its limited ability to capture long-distance dependencies in sequences. Conversely, graph-based models demonstrate better capability in capturing semantic structure features. Distinguished from BiGCN, our method constructs entity-sentence heterogeneous graphs, facilitating enhanced capture of structure features. Compared to ClaHi-GAT, we introduce Entity-Aware Heterogeneous Attention to discern the significance of different meta-paths automatically. Moreover, by leveraging chatGPT to extract knowledge and augment entities based on context, CICAN out-\nperforms knowledge-based models, KMGCN and DDGCN, especially in dealing with complex semantic structures. The results confirm that CICAN can extract complex content features and capture semantic structure information, effectively enhancing text understanding and key feature extraction capabilities."

            "text": "We conduct a series of ablation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the individual modules of the CICAN model. The specific ablation experiments include the following aspects: w/o CIS: Remove the crowd intelligencebased semantic feature learning module. w/o CIS -TweetBERT: Replace TweetBERT in CIS for BERT. w/o CIS-cap: Only remove the capsule network in CIS. w/o CIS-BiLSTM: Only remove the BiLSTM in CIS. w/o KSS: Remove the knowledgebased semantic structure mining module. w/o KSSES graph: Remove the entity-sentence heterogeneous graph in KSS. w/o KSS-EE: Remove the Context-Based Entity Enhancement in KSS.\nThe experimental results are summarized in Table 2. w/o CIS has a significant decrease in the accuracy of the Twitter15 and Twitter16 datasets (decreased by 3.8% and 2.7%), which shows that this module plays a vital role in enhancing semantic representation and mining semantic information. Similarly, w/o CIS-TweetBERT also significantly impacts model performance, indicating that TweetBERT has superior context-dependent processing capabilities when processing text on social networks compared to BERT. Compared with w/o BiLSTM, the accuracy rate of w/o cap is lower because the capsule network can aggregate inputs from multiple directions when processing shorter texts, which is more robust. This result further validates the effectiveness of the method in this paper.\nw/o KSS leads to 3.2% and 2.3% decrease in the accuracy of Twitter15 and Twitter16 datasets, respectively, emphasizing the significance of extracting structured knowledge and establishing global semantic connections to improve the model\u2019s understanding and judgment of text. The performance drops significantly when directly replacing entitysentence heterogeneous graphs with directly concatenated entity results (w/o KSS-ES graph) because heterogeneous graphs can establish global semantic connections and contextual associations.\nThe comparison between w/o CIS and w/o KSS shows that w/o CIS significantly impacts the model\u2019s performance, indicating the effectiveness of the pre-trained model based on social network and multi-granularity feature extraction in fully mining features. However, introducing external knowledge (mainly involving modeling entity reinforcement and semantic structure) provides a complementary effect on the model\u2019s performance and enhances the model\u2019s generalization ability to unseen data."

In our experiments, we compare the performance of different methods by incrementally increasing the test data. As shown in Figure 3, even in the initial stage with limited comment quantities, our proposed CICAN model exhibited high accuracy. For instance, with only 30 comments, the CICAN model achieved accuracies of 74.3% and 71.8% on Twitter15 and Twitter16, respectively, demonstrating its ability to capture critical semantic features. It can be seen from the figure that the performance of all models fluctuates during training due to the increase of semantic information and noise in social networks. However, the CICAN model comprehensively considers semantic content and semantic structure information, so it has generalization and robustness and can consistently perform well. The CICAN model outperformed other models at each stage, confirming the effectiveness of early rumor detection and significantly improving detection performance."

            "text": "This study introduces a novel rumor detection model, the Crowd Intelligence and ChatGPTAssisted Network (CICAN), which combines se-\nmantic content and structure information for rumor detection. In the crowd intelligence-based semantic feature learning module, we employ contextual semantic encoders and multi-granularity feature extractors to capture the semantic content information. In the knowledge-based semantic structure mining module, to capture complex semantic structural information, we extract refined knowledge utilizing ChatGPT to construct an entity-sentence heterogeneous graph and design entity-aware heterogeneous attention to integrate representations from different meta-paths effectively. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the CICAN model in leveraging crowd intelligence and external knowledge, resulting in significant performance improvements in rumor detection tasks.\nFuture research directions can further expand the field of rumor detection in several ways. First, take inspiration from truth-finding systems that leverage human intelligence to extract reliable information from multiple sources. Second, to explore quantum cognition, using quantum theory to explain human behavior related to rumor detection. Finally, the application of large models in rumor detection can be further mined to improve the performance and interpretability of the models.\nLimitations\nIn this section, we discuss the limitations of our work and propose corresponding solutions. First, we exploit the semantic information of crowd intelligence for rumor detection. However, the user\u2019s profile, historical activity, or social network structure should also be considered. Future research will focus on capturing user features related to rumor spreading to improve detection accuracy. Second, ChatGPT shows promising results in data augmentation and concept extraction in this study. However, its effectiveness largely depends on the quality and design of the prompts used. Therefore, further research to explore more effective prompt engineering techniques, especially for customizing rumor detection tasks, is expected to improve model performance.\nEthics Statement\nThis article deals with social media data, specifically social media data on Twitter. The benchmark datasets we experiment with for classification are publicly available in previous work, follow all Twitter regulations, and extract data through the official API. To mitigate the potential impact of using such data, all tweets related to the dataset were anonymized, and URLs were removed to ensure individual users\u2019 privacy and data security. This research aims to analyze and explore the methods and techniques of rumor detection to improve the credibility and reliability of information on social media. We will report the experimental results objectively, transparently, and comprehensively following academic norms and ethical standards."

The statistical details of these datasets are summarized in Table 3.\nB Implementation Details\nWe provide further details regarding the implementation of the models. The models were implemented using the PyTorch framework and executed on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. Specific parameter values were assigned to each module of the models: In the crowd intelligence-based semantic feature learning module, the number of hidden units in the TweetBert layer is 768. Pre-trained model parameters are utilized, and their weights are frozen to prevent overfitting. The BiLSTM layer consists of 256 hidden units. The size of the convolutional kernels (k) is fine-tuned among the options {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and eventually set to {2, 3, 4}. The number of convolutional kernels (k_num) is fixed at 256. The capsule network layer contains a variable number of capsules (cin) selected from {2, 4, 6, 8, 16}, with the final choice being 4. The output dimension of each capsule (cdim) is set to 50. The number of iterations for capsule dynamic routing (r) is determined from {1, 3, 5, 7}, with the chosen value being 3. In the knowledge-based semantic structure mining module, we utilized GloVe 300d (Pennington et al., 2014) word embedding to encode individual entities and sentences. To enhance the effectiveness of Entity-Aware Hierarchical Attention, we experimented with different numbers of attention heads (K) and evaluated their impact on performance. Specifically, we explored the options {1, 2, 4, 6, 8} for K and determined that setting K to 4 yielded optimal results. The cross-entropy loss function is employed during training to assess the disparity between the predicted results and the true labels. Through backpropagation, parameter updates are carried out using the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). An early stopping (Yao et al., 2007) strategy is adopted to prevent overfitting. These parameter settings ensure reproducibility, fairness, and accurate experimental results."

We developed prompts for ChatGPT (as shown in Prompt 3 of Appendix C) and conducted experiments with 0-shot, 2-shot, and 5-shot samples for each class in the target domain. The\nresults of the experiments are shown in Figure 6.\nIt can be seen from the figure that the ChatGPT-Assisted method can improve the accuracy of text classification, but using ChatGPT alone for text classification may be limited because it is not designed explicitly for text classification tasks or pre-trained with data from social networks. On the contrary, using ChatGPT for knowledge extraction can combine its powerful generative ability with the contextual information of the original text, which helps the model capture the latent features of the text, thereby improving the accuracy of text classification. At the same time, the training of ChatGPT is very dependent on the quality of the prompt. Few-shot results are better than zero-shot because when dealing with zero-shot classification, ChatGPT generates labels or data that do not correspond to the given label set, resulting in lower accu-\nTable 4: The effectiveness analysis of the methods\nEntity Enhancement Hierarchical Attention Dataset\nCICAN-Non CICAN-ConceptAtt CICAN-Concat CICAN-SemanticAtt CICAN\nTweet15 0.827 0.838 0.840 0.846 0.855 Tweet16 0.820 0.833 0.837 0.835 0.840\nFigure 6: Performance comparison of ChatGPT and ChatGPT-Assisted\nracy. To alleviate this problem, ChatGPT needs to be provided with examples that help it understand the content and facilitate accurate classification.\nMethod Effectiveness Analysis We performed a comparative analysis with\ncommonly used methods to demonstrate the efficacy of the optimization methods proposed in the model (Context-based Entity Enhancement and Entity-Aware Hierarchical Attention). Table 4 presents the experimental results of CICAN and the following models based on different modeling methods. According to different modeling methods, it mainly includes the following models.\n1) CICAN-Non: No entity enhancement. 2) CICAN-ConceptAtt: Use Concept Atten-\ntion to replace the Context-based Entity Enhancement method. Concept Attention is a method first proposed in MKEMN (Zhang et al., 2019) to measure the semantic similarity between concepts and entity representations. 3) CICAN-concat: Concat the representation of the meta-path to replace the Entity-Aware Hierarchical Attention method. 4) CICAN-SemanticAtt: Use Semantic Attention to replace the Entity-Aware Hierarchical Attention method. Semantic Attention is a method proposed in HAN (Wang et al., 2019) to calculate the importance of different meta-paths through nonlinear transformation.\nEffectiveness of Context-based Entity Enhancement Methods Compared to CICAN-Non, CICAN achieved an accuracy improvement of 2.8% and 2% on Twitter15 and Twitter16, respectively. Furthermore, compared to CICAN-ConceptAtt, CICAN demonstrated an accuracy improvement of 1.7% and 0.7% on Twitter15 and Twitter16, respectively. The context-based entity augmentation method shows the best performance in the rumor detection task. The method combines attention computation to capture the relationship between entities and the whole sentence and then applies attention weights to enhance the context-based entity enhancement representation. This finding underscores the significance of context-aware entity enhancement in the context of rumor detection tasks. Effectiveness of Entity-Aware Hierarchical Attention Method By comparing the experimental results, it can be observed that the performance of CICAN-concat and CICAN-SemanticAtt are comparable, while Entity-Aware Hierarchical Attention demonstrates relatively superior performance. Our Entity-Aware Hierarchical Attention performs relatively superior, increasing accuracy by 1.5% and 0.3% on the two datasets, respectively. Due to the complex and diverse associations among different meta-paths in the heterogeneous graph, the co-attention mechanism employed in Entity-Aware Hierarchical Attention can more effectively capture meta-paths\u2019 independence and collaborative interactions. Overall, these results indicate the superiority of CICAN over its comparative models and highlight the importance of incorporating attention mechanisms and context-aware entity augmentation during the modeling process in the context of rumor detection tasks to achieve more accurate and robust rumor detection."

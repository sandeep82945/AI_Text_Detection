    "abstractText": "Designing systems that can reason across cultures requires that they are grounded in the norms of the contexts in which they operate. However, current research on developing computational models of social norms has primarily focused on American society. Here, we propose a novel approach to discover and compare descriptive social norms across Chinese and American cultures. We demonstrate our approach by leveraging discussions on a Chinese Q&A platform\u2014\u77e5\u4e4e (Zhihu)\u2014and the existing SOCIALCHEMISTRY dataset as proxies for contrasting cultural axes, align social situations cross-culturally, and extract social norms from texts using in-context learning. Embedding Chain-of-Thought prompting in a human-AI collaborative framework, we build a high-quality dataset of 3,069 social norms aligned with social situations across Chinese and American cultures alongside corresponding free-text explanations. To test the ability of models to reason about social norms across cultures, we introduce the task of explainable social norm entailment, showing that existing models under 3B parameters have significant room for improvement in both automatic and human evaluation. Further analysis of crosscultural norm differences based on our dataset shows empirical alignment with the social orientations framework, revealing several situational and descriptive nuances in norms across these cultures.",

Deviance from these expectations of behavior can cause perceptions of impoliteness (Culpeper, 2011), feelings of offense (Rubington and Weinberg, 2015), and pragmatic failure (Thomas, 1983). Social norms vary across cultures (Triandis et al., 1994; Finnemore, 1996), and different cultural\n\u2217Equal Contribution.\nnorms can lead to conflict within intercultural interactions due to perceptions of deviance (Durkheim, 1951). Creating computational systems that can robustly reason and translate across cultures in pragmatic communication requires that they be grounded in these norms and their differences across contexts. As an initial step in addressing this question, we propose a novel approach to discover and compare social norms conditioned on social situations across Chinese and American cultures. Leveraging \u77e5\u4e4e (Zhihu), a Chinese Q&A platform, alongside the existing SOCIALCHEMISTRY (Forbes et al., 2020) dataset on social norms as respective proxies of Chinese and American cultural axes, our paper offers the following contributions:\n\u2022 A human-AI collaboration framework for cross-cultural descriptive norm discovery consisting of (1) automatic situation alignment using cross-lingual similarity between\nSOCIALCHEMSTRY situations and questions from Zhihu, (2) Chinese social norm extraction from Zhihu answers using few-shot prompting with GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), (3) cross-cultural norm similarity and difference identification as textual entailment with explanations using GPT-3 with Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting (Wei et al., 2022); and (4) human feedback in verification and editing. An example of outputs is shown in Figure 1.\n\u2022 A new dataset for cross-cultural norms understanding with explainable textual entailment. Our human-AI collaboration enables us to create a novel dataset of 3069 situationaligned entailment pairs of Chinese and American norms together with textual explanations. We introduce the new task of explainable social norm entailment and show that it is challenging for models fine-tuned on related tasks; fine-tuning on our task directly still leaves significant space for improvement.\n\u2022 An analysis of cross-cultural differences in social norms enabled by our dataset. In Section 6, we show that the analysis enabled by our dataset empirically aligns with prior work on differences in Chinese and American cultures. Our empirical results align with the social orientations framework (Yang, 1993) in understanding Chinese-American norm differences and reveal several situational and descriptive nuances in norms across these cultures."

            "text": "Our work is situated in the broader literature on the study of social norms (Sherif, 1936) and how they vary across cultures (Thomas, 1983). Here, our work is rooted specifically in the study of descriptive norms (Rawls, 1951, 2004; Cialdini et al., 1990)\u2014what people actually do, rather than prescriptive norms, or what they think people ought to do\u2014and focuses on the differences between Chinese and American cultures.\nWe build on recent computational work in creating systems capable of situated reasoning in social situations, most closely adapting the rule-ofthumb formalism for descriptive norms introduced in Forbes et al. (2020). This line of work not only spans that of commonsense reasoning (Sap et al., 2019; Rashkin et al., 2018), but also in judg-\nments of appropriate and ethical behavior (Emelin et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2022) and in grounding behavior in areas like dialogue (Ziems et al., 2022) and situated question answering (Gu et al., 2022a) more specifically on underlying knowledge of social norms. In recognizing that social norms are often culturally (Haidt et al., 1993) and even demographically (Plepi et al., 2022; Wan et al., 2023) specific, prior work in this area has primarily revolved around the normative judgments of majority English-speaking cultures represented within North America. In contrast, here, aligning with the broader goal of creating systems that can effectively reason across cultures and languages (Liu et al., 2021), we focus on computationally studying norms across Chinese and American cultures, expanding on the utility of large language models in ways that have the potential to transform modern computational social science (Ziems et al., 2023).\nContemporary studies of Chinese cultural societies (Yang, 1993) emphasize several broad differences relative to American culture. Under the framework of social orientations, emphasis in Chinese society is placed especially on family, relationship, authority, and personal reputation social orientations. In particular, past work has shown a large significance compared to American culture in familistic collectivism and harmony (Ch\u2019engK\u2019Un, 1944; Yang, 1988; Campos et al., 2014), relational determinism (Chen and Chen, 2004; Chua et al., 2009), and authority worship (Yang, 1970; Thornton and Fricke, 1987; Hu, 2016), among other factors, in influencing social behavior. Critical reviews of past cross-cultural work have criticized weaknesses in study design and their overly broad generalizations (Voronov and Singer, 2002), in favor of a more fine-grained analysis. Here, under the framework of descriptive norms and sourcing data from social media at scale, we conduct a more nuanced analysis of how norms vary across cultures under situational controls."

Similar to its international counterparts like Quora, Zhihu is primarily a Q&A site where users can post questions, answer existing questions, and up-vote answers to questions by other users, among other platform interactions. Users are 59% women (Yang, 2022a) and are primarily educated and middle-class, with research showing that over 80% of its users possess at least a bachelor\u2019s degree (Zhang, 2020). This population is significant because the middle class is the primary upholder of social stability (Goodman, 2014) and the primary driver of cultural trends and public opinion (Denemark and Chubb, 2016) in China. An example of a Zhihu question-answer pair is shown in Table 1.\nQuestions on Zhihu are often posed as to in1Despite the many demographic similarities between our two cultural axes, a few notable differences remain.

Following the rationale that social norms are the most common and broadly accepted judgments of actions in given situations, we take the most up-voted answer2 to each question as the basis from which we extract social norms, described in the following section. In total, we obtained answers to 508,681 unique questions posed on Zhihu. The study and data collection were approved by an Institutional Review Board prior to data collection; a detailed breakdown of this corpus is detailed in Appendix Section A.

An illustration of our human-AI collaboration framework is presented in Figure 2.\nAligning Situations Across Cultures. Descriptive judgments of appropriate behavior are often situationally-dependent (Leung and Morris, 2015); an accurate comparison of norms across cultures must first ensure a similarity of contexts. For instance, Yamagishi et al. (2008) showed that Japanese preferences for conformity disappeared in private compared to when they were being observed. To obtain the closest matching situations between US and Chinese contexts, we align situations found in the SOCIALCHEMISTRY dataset with similar questions on Zhihu. While the Zhihu search API allows for direct query searches of platform content, semantic alignment of returned results with queries remains low due to an observed bias in prioritizing entity matches. To improve this alignment of situations between US and Chinese contexts, we use XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) to obtain cross-lingual representations of situations and further perform one-to-one matching through cosine similarity. Setting the similarity threshold to 0.895 allowed us to align 3069 situations, of which around 80% were correctly aligned, based on a manual review of a random sample of 100 situations. Here, incorrectly aligned instances remain valuable for our data as negative samples in our later entailment task as they can be assigned a No Relation label.\nSocial Norm Extraction. We follow the formalism introduced by Forbes et al. (2020) in structuring descriptive norms as rules-of-thumb, or judgments of an action (i.e., \u201cIt\u2019s rude to run the blender at 5AM\u201d). Taking 2 random top-aligned situations in our dataset, we manually annotate their corresponding Zhihu answer for social norms in ruleof-thumb form (RoT); an example of such an annotation is shown in Table 1. We then design a 2-shot prompt using these annotations (Table 3) and use GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to extract novel rules-of-thumb from unseen answers. Running this model across all aligned situations and following a manual verification of faithfulness, we obtain a total of 6566 unique rules-of-thumb for our Chinese axis, relative to 1173 unique rules-of-thumb for our American axis sourced from SOCIALCHEMISTRY (note, here, that a rule-of-thumb may be associated with multiple situations)."

            "text": "Differences as Textual Entailment with Explanations. Under our formalism, a difference in cultural norms equates to a disagreement in judgments for an action relative to a given situation. Here, we structure the identification of social norm differences across cultures as an explainable textual entailment task (a.k.a natural language inference (NLI)) similar to e-SNLI (Camburu et al., 2018); a difference in cultural norms equates to a contradiction between norms of different cultures for a given situation, and vice versa for entailment. Given the recent success of human-AI collaboration frameworks (Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Bartolo et al., 2022; Chakrabarty et al., 2022), the complex nature of\nour task, and the need for interoperability in reasoning, we use Chain-of-Thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022) (see our prompt in Table 4) together with GPT-3 (text-davinci-003) to generate most of the data automatically before manual verification. In order to construct our data in the e-SNLI format and save on computation costs, for every given American norm associated with a given situation, we (1) select the most relevant Chinese norm for that situation as extracted in the previous step, (2) identify the inference relationship (entailment, contradiction, or no relation) between them, and (3) generate a free-text explanation for the identified relationship. When no Chinese norms are selected as relevant, a random norm is sampled from the aligned candidates, and an explanation is generated given the No Relation label. Using this framework, we generate social norm relationships and their justifications for all cross-culturally aligned situations in our dataset.\nHuman Verification and Editing. To ensure the quality and accuracy of our dataset of situated social norm relationships and their justifications across cultures, three annotators with significant (10+ years) lived experiences in both Chinese and American cultures further acted as annotators by jointly verifying and editing, if needed, the outputs of our framework (Figure 2). Specifically, authors ensured that (1) situations are correctly aligned (i.e., entailment or contradiction labels are assigned correctly to aligned norms, while no relation labels are assigned to misaligned norms), (2) norms generated by GPT-3 are not hallucinated, and (3) the explanations are correct. Annotators were able to discuss any questions and resolve any final disagreements with each other. In total, we find that 51% of norms had a no relation label, either due to misaligned situations or due to the absence of\nextracted, relevant Chinese norms for corresponding US norms. Only a few instances (around 5%) had hallucinated norms; all were further corrected during annotation.\nGenerated explanations needed no further editing in 58.9% of the cases. In 38.1% of the cases, the inferred cross-cultural norm relation (and corresponding explanations) were deemed incorrect and required the revision of both the label and the explanation, while in the remaining instances (3.0%), generated explanations still required major revisions even though the relation label was deemed correct. Our final dataset contains 3,069 NLI instances of social norm relations across cultures with explanations. Out of these, 432 are contradictions (14%), 1059 are entailments (35%), and 1578 have a no relation label (51%). In total, aligned norms comprise 1173 unique rules-of-thumb from SOCIALCHEMISTRY (American axis) and 2273 as obtained from Zhihu using our framework (Chinese axis), with social norm description length averaging 63.5 characters. For social norm extraction, situation length was limited to 300 characters; examples from our dataset are shown in Table 2."

            "text": "Task. To test the ability of models to reason about social norms across cultures, we introduce the task of explainable social norm entailment. Our task is closely related to the explainable natural language inference task, e-SNLI (Camburu et al., 2018), where, in addition to the relation label, a model has to output a natural language explanation for its prediction as well. For every pair of US and Chinese norms of a cross-culturally aligned situation, we ask a model to predict the relationship between them (Entailment, Contradiction, or No Relation) and output an explanation for the relation. We test\nwhether models fine-tuned on existing closely related and much larger textual entailment datasets (e.g., e-SNLI) and instruction-tuned models like FLAN-T5 can perform the task of explainable social norm entailment in addition to a simple finetuned baseline. In evaluation, we center our focus on explanation plausibility, testing if fine-tuning on our data may enhance a model\u2019s ability to reason about social norm entailment.\nModels. We focus on smaller models on the order of 3B parameters and on non-OpenAI models, as an OpenAI model was used to generate our data. Here, we test the performance of a model finetuned on SOCIALCHEMISTRY rule elaborations (DREAM) and an instruction-tuned model (FLANT5) in few-shot settings, and further fine-tune joint self-rationalizing models on eSNLI and our dataset.\nPrior work in interpretability (Wiegreffe et al., 2021) has shown that rationales from joint selfrationalizing models\u2014predicting both the explanation alongside the relation label\u2014are capable of producing faithful free-text rationales. Following prior work (Chakrabarty et al., 2022), we fine-tune a joint self-rationalizing T5 model in multiple settings, randomly splitting our data into 65% train, 10% validation, and 25% test set splits (Appendix Section C).\n\u2022 DREAM (Gu et al., 2022a): an elaboration model that uses T5 to generate details about the input. Here, we test the DREAM-FLUTE (social-norm) variant (Gu et al., 2022b), which uses SOCIALCHEMISTRY rules-of-thumb as\nelaborations to provide an answer containing a label and an explanation. We evaluate this model in a 10-shot setting.\n\u2022 FLAN-T5-XL (Chung et al., 2022): an enhanced version of the T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) 3B model fine-tuned on more than 1000 tasks, including e-SNLI (Camburu et al., 2018). We evaluate this model in a 10-shot setting.\n\u2022 T5-eSNLI: a T5 3B model fine-tuned on the e-SNLI (Camburu et al., 2018) dataset. We fine-tune for two epochs with a batch size of 4096, with 268 total steps, and an AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 5e\u2212 05. We take the longest explanation per example in e-SNLI, as our data contains only one reference explanation. This leaves us with 549,367 training and 9,842 validation examples.\n\u2022 {mT5, T5}-SocNorm: a T5 3B model finetuned on our Social Norm Explainable NLI dataset. We fine-tune for 20 epochs with a batch size of 256 (with 140 total steps) and an AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 5e\u2212 05. Note, here, that our training set of 2,000 examples (see Table 8) is 274 times smaller than e-SNLI. We fine-tune a mT5 model in the same setting to explore how multilingual pretraining may impact in multicultural social norm understanding.\nAutomatic Metrics. Following Chakrabarty et al. (2022), we evaluate the quality of model-generated\nexplanations using the explanation score metric: an average of BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020; Pu et al., 2021) and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019). We report the macro average F1 score at three thresholds of the explanation score: 0, 50, and 60. F1@0 is equivalent to simply computing the F1 score, while F1@50 counts only the correctly predicted labels that achieve an explanation score greater than 50 as correct.\nAs shown in Table 5, current off-the-shelf models under 3B parameters lack heavily in performance on our dataset, at most achieving an F1 score of 33.48, despite being fine-tuned on closely related tasks like e-SNLI. This verifies the need for a domain-specific dataset, as general NLI data is observed to be insufficient to perform well on our task. Furthermore, even the model fine-tuned on our data only achieves 54.52 F1 score, showing that there is still ample room for improvement in this domain.\nWhen considering explanation quality, we see a very steep drop in performance from F1@0 to F1@60 for models fine-tuned on related tasks (72.50% for FLAN-T5 and 96.59% for T5-eSNLI), indicating that current datasets do not enable sufficient explanation quality for reasoning about social norm entailment. For the models fine-tuned on our data, the performance drop when accounting for explanation quality is not as sharp (\u2248 21% for T5-SocNorm and mT5-SocNorm).\nInterestingly, FLAN-T5 achieves a lower F1@0 score than a model fine-tuned on eSNLI, possibly because of interference from non-eSNLI-related tasks that it was fine-tuned on. Further investigating performance differences between T5-eSNLI and FLAN-T5 (see Table 6), we observe that FLAN-T5 struggles, in particular, to predict all relation classes equally well, instead predicting\nmost classes as No Relation (the majority class). This also explains the better performance of FLANT5 when accounting for the explanation score, as neutral explanations are easier to generate and typically more templatic in structure. T5-SocNorm and T5-eSNLI are seen as more robust in this regard.\nExplanation Quality. Wiegreffe et al. (2021) introduced an automatic metric for textual explanation quality, termed as rationale quality, that compares the accuracy of the model with and without provided explanations. We fine-tune models to predict the relation label given an input and an explanation, in addition to giving only the input. When providing \u201cgold\u201d explanations, accuracy rises from 53.4% to 96.1% (with a rationale quality of 42.7), emphasizing the quality of textual explanations provided by our dataset.\nHuman Evaluation of Generated Explanation Plausibility. Three students with significant lived experiences (10+ years) in Chinese and American cultures assessed the quality of a subset of 50 randomly chosen model-generated explanations for correctly predicted labels, evaluating performance between the best performing model finetuned only on related tasks (T5-eSNLI) and the best-performing model that was directly fine-tuned on our dataset (T5-SocNorm). Each annotator was asked to rate which generated explanation they preferred, allowing for the presence of ties. Annotators showed an inter-annotator agreement of 62.4 in Fleiss\u2019 kappa (Fleiss, 1971), considered to be \u201csubstantial\" agreement in existing literature. T5-SocNorm explanations are preferred for the vast majority of instances (73%); T5-eSNLI explanations were preferred in only 11% of instances, while explanations from both tied for the rest (16%). An example of a bad generation from T5-eSNLI is shown in Table 7; as shown, T5SocNorm tries to determine the attitude the norms\nexpresses, while T5-eSNLI instead attempts to generate a rule-of-thumb (in red) instead. These results are indicative of how our data contains high-quality explanations\u2014despite its small scale, models finetuned on it are able to produce better explanations compared to a model fine-tuned on the entirety of e-SNLI, which is 247 times larger in size."

To capture thematic trends across situations, we train a 10-topic LDA model on preprocessed situations and manually label each topic with its most prominent theme; labeled situational topics alongside the top words that are associated with each are shown in Appendix Section D. Testing for the effect of topic-situational factors on differences in social norms, we measure the correlation strength between the probability of a situation belonging to a given topic against how likely norms will contradict for that given situation.\nIn this regression, we find that three situation topics positively predicted how likely norms would contradict between Chinese and American cultures for a given situation to a statistically significant degree. They are, as follows, Lack of Intimacy/Separation (\u03c1 = 0.07, p = 0.01), Family Discord/Divorce (\u03c1 = 0.06, p = 0.01), and Loss of Family Connection/Changes in Life (\u03c1 = 0.07, p = 0.02).\nThough these effect sizes remain small in scale likely due to the limited size of our dataset, these findings are consistent with contemporary studies\nof Chinese cultural societies under the framework of social orientations (Yang, 1993). In Chinese culture, relational determinism strongly defines the social norms surrounding social interactions in everyday situations (Chen et al., 2013). One\u2019s relationship with another determines how one interacts with them; much distinction is placed within Chinese culture between one\u2019s own kith and kin (\u81ea\u5df1\u4eba, zijiren)\u2014which mostly includes family members and familiar persons such as friends or classmates\u2014and outsiders (\u5916\u4eba, wairen), at a much stronger degree than that which is present in American cultures (Chen and Chen, 2004; Chua et al., 2009). Our results here show that in situations where this relationship distinction is apparent, or in cases of change in relationship type, the norms surrounding these situations are more likely to differ across Chinese and American cultures.\nDescriptive Effects. As we have done for situational effects, here, we train a 10-topic LDA model on preprocessed norms in rules-of-thumb form, identify each norm topic\u2019s most prominent theme, and test for the effect of norm-topic factors on predicting differences in these norms between Chinese and American cultures. As before, labeled norm topics alongside their top words are shown in Appendix Section D.\nRecalling that norms in rule-of-thumb form are judgments of actions, norm topics associate with action topics; a contradiction between crossculturally aligned norms means that contrasting judgments are placed on those actions across Chinese and American cultures. Here, we find that two norm topics positively predicted how likely a contradiction would be present between the norms of our two cultures. They are, specifically, Loss of Trust/Intimacy (\u03c1 = 0.06, p = 0.05) and Support in Relationship (\u03c1 = 0.04, p = 0.04).\nInterpreting these descriptive results in the context of relational determinism, our results above on situational effects, and through further qualitative analysis, our findings show that differences exist between Chinese and American cultures in judgments of actions that (1) would cause a loss of trust or intimacy and (2) are taken to support an individual close to you. These findings are consistent with longstanding work in Chinese familism (Ch\u2019engK\u2019Un, 1944; Yang, 1988; Campos et al., 2014), showing that exceptional accommodations in circumventing typical social rules are made, relative to American cultures, to pursue interpersonal and\nespecially familial harmony for those classed as one\u2019s own kith and kin (Dunfee and Warren, 2001; Chen et al., 2013)."

Our analyses here reveal several nuances in how social norms vary across these cultural contexts, incorporating principles of descriptive ethics that prior studies have often lacked thus far. We see our present work situated in the broader context of designing systems that are able to reason across languages and cultures in an increasingly interconnected global world. Here, we highlight a few directions we find exciting for future work; models, code, and anonymized data are made available for further research.3\nDeviance from social norms can lead to miscommunication and pragmatic failure (Thomas, 1983). Integrating cross-cultural norm knowledge into socially situated communication systems (Hovy and Yang, 2021) could lead to fewer miscommunications in everyday situations, bridge cultures, and increase the accessibility of knowledge and of interpersonal technologies to a far greater extent than traditional translation technologies.\nWhile our work has focused on measuring differences in social norms across cultures, culture, though important, is only one of many variables\u2014 like age and gender, among others\u2014that affect descriptive ethical judgments (Kuntsche et al., 2021). Neither are norms fixed in time (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998; Sethi and Somanathan, 1996); future work could, with the aid of social platforms like Zhihu and Reddit, quantitatively examine not only the evolution of social norms across cultures and platforms but also compare changes between cultures, further bridging theory and empirical study."

            "text": "studying cultural variations in social norms, we do not argue that culture as a variable alone explains the entirety of the observed variations. Most notably, intra-cultural variation in social norms also exists depending on the scale examined; for example, among multiple demographic groups or sub-communities (Plepi et al., 2022; Wan et al., 2023). Further, as the presence of variation in user and participant demographics undoubtedly remains between the data from our opposite cultural axes, it is crucial to interpret our results in the context of these differences and to take note that findings in our data are biased toward representing the viewpoints of individuals of these demographic groups.\nValue Pluralism. There are often more than one\u2014and often contradictory\u2014social norms that are relevant to any given social situation, which are often in tension with each other in many social dilemmas. By performing norm comparison using only the top-up-voted answer for given social situations, we necessarily limit the scope of our work to the social norms that are, by design assumptions and by proxy, the most accepted social norms for any given social situation. It is important to note that this does not preclude the possibility that similar social norms may remain valid for each culture at differing levels of acceptance. Here, while annotators with significant lived experiences in each culture sanity-checked that the entailment relations assigned between norms across cultures corresponded to actual cross-cultural differences and not simply because of value pluralism, this does not entirely ensure that the cross-cultural norm differences we observe are not because of value pluralism, as it is impossible for annotators to be aware of every single norm in an ever-evolving social landscape. We believe this to be a rich area of\nfuture work to more quantitatively study instances of value pluralism even for norms of a single culture, and to see which norms ultimately \u201cwin over\u201d the others for certain situations (Sorensen et al., 2023).\nData Coverage. It is unrealistic to expect that either our data or that of Social Chemistry can cover all possible social situations. As such, our findings only represent a subset of the true underlying cultural differences present between the norms of Chinese and American cultures. Furthermore, it seems intuitive that questions about non-controversial social situations \u201ceveryone\u201d is familiar with will, if not be completely absent from online discourse, otherwise get lower representation and engagement. As we only extract from the most up-voted answer from each Zhihu discussion and treat it as the most broadly adopted norm as a simplifying assumption, an open question remains as to quantifying the \u201cproblem\u201d of intra-cultural norm disagreements and to investigate genuine human variations in judgments of social norms (Plank, 2022). By releasing our data, we hope that future work can take into account less up-voted answers. In moving towards more representative studies, we encourage further work to examine these variations in intra-cultural norms and tease out the details of human behavior.\nCensorship and Moderation. Chinese social media platforms like Weibo, and Wechat are mandated by law (Xu and Albert, 2014) to implement censorship policies on the content created by their users. Zhihu is no different; the presence of inherent content bias introduced by this form of active moderation of user content has an effect on influencing the landscape of public discourse (Yang, 2022b) and the data that we rely on to derive Chinese social norms. In particular, past work has shown the existence of censorship programs aimed at prohibiting \"collective action by silencing comments that represent, reinforce, or spur social mobilization\" across primary Chinese social media services (King et al., 2013). Comments that contain politically sensitive terms, such as mentions of the names of political leaders, are subject to a higher rate of deletions (Bamman et al., 2012). The extent to which these actions lead to a biased public representation of the norms and beliefs commonly shared in Chinese society remains unclear.\nLanguage Model Biases. Advances in large language models like GPT-4 have allowed for greater\npossibilities in human-AI collaboration, as we have done here. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that language models ultimately mimic patterns in their training data (Lucy and Bamman, 2021) and regurgitate structural and social biases (Bender et al., 2021). While we have incorporated these models under a human-AI collaboration framework where we externally verify, validate, and edit their output in certain cases to mitigate this risk, it would be remiss to say that we are capable of doing so entirely in lieu of effects such as priming influencing our decisions."

Notably, however, the F1@60 score of GPT-4\u2014the better performing of the two\u2014remains lower in comparison with our best-fine-tuned model (41.18 vs. 43.07); furthermore, the relative decrease from F1@0 to F1@60 (%\u2206) of GPT-4 remains higher than our model (34% vs 21%) as well, indicative of the possibility that distilled models may even surpass teacher models in explanation quality."

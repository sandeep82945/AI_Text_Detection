    "abstractText": "We present a design framework called Conversational Learning with Analytical Step-byStep Strategies (CLASS) for building advanced Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) powered by high-performance Large Language Models (LLMs). The CLASS framework empowers ITS with two key capabilities. First, through a carefully curated scaffolding dataset, CLASS equips ITS with essential problemsolving strategies, enabling it to provide tutorlike, step-by-step guidance to students. Second, by using a dynamic conversational dataset, CLASS assists ITS in facilitating natural language interactions, fostering engaging studenttutor conversations. The CLASS framework also provides valuable insights into ITS\u2019s internal decision-making process which allows seamless integration of user feedback, thus enabling continuous refinement and improvement. We also present a proof-of-concept ITS, referred to as SPOCK, which is trained using the CLASS framework with a focus on introductory college-level biology content. A carefully constructed protocol was developed for SPOCK\u2019s preliminary evaluation, examining aspects such as the factual accuracy and relevance of its responses. Experts in the field of biology offered favorable remarks, particularly highlighting SPOCK\u2019s capability to break down questions into manageable subproblems and provide encouraging responses to students.",

However, the development of effective ITS remains a challenge, particularly in addressing the diverse learning needs of students and promoting a deeper understanding of complex concepts. Drawing on the potential of\nrecent advancements in natural language processing, chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT (Bubeck et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023) present an opportunity to build upon the existing ITS and further improve ITS by integrating LLMs with learning science principles (Macina et al., 2023; Sonkar et al., 2023). The application of learning science principles is crucial for developing ITS that effectively supports learners in their cognitive processes, provides personalized assistance, and fosters engaging learning experience (Wing, 2006; Shute et al., 2017).\nIn this study, we present a novel design framework called Conversational Learning with Analytical Step-by-Step Strategies (CLASS) that integrates these principles to create an effective language model-based ITS for biology, referred to as SPOCK1. The core objective of the CLASS framework is to equip ITS with two important capabilities: 1) providing tutor-like step-by-step guidance that fosters learners\u2019 deeper understanding 2) engaging learners in tutor-like conversations using natural language to ensure conversational adaptability. CLASS utilizes two specifically curated training datasets to instill the desired capabilities in SPOCK while aligning with learning science principles.\nThe first dataset, \u201cscaffolding dataset\u201d, is grounded in problem decomposition and scaffolding learning principles (Wing, 2006; Shute et al., 2017). This dataset covers essential components such as problems, related subproblems, hints, incorrect solutions, and customized feedback.\nThe second \u201cconversational dataset\u201d builds on the foundation established by the scaffolding dataset and focuses on simulated conversational student-tutor interactions inspired by the socioconstructivist model of learning (Stone, 1998). The conversations, generated by GPT-4, incorporates\n1Code and models are available at https://github.com/ luffycodes/Tutorbot-Spock\nelements of effective praise and encouraging tutor reactions to student errors (Thomas et al., 2023), ensuring that SPOCK provides immediate, earned, truthful, specific, and genuine feedback focused on the learning process.\nWithin the conversations contained in the second dataset, a pre-defined response template is employed to ensure consistency and coherence in SPOCK\u2019s responses across various situations. This structured approach facilitates seamless user feedback incorporation and system enhancement by offering insights into SPOCK\u2019s internal decisionmaking mechanisms for continuous improvement and refinement.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n1. We introduce a novel CLASS framework for building ITS, utilizing two synthetic datasets: the scaffolding dataset for tutor-like, step-bystep guidance, and the conversational dataset for engaging interactions with learners.\n2. We present SPOCK, a proof-of-concept ITS system designed for college-level biology, developed under the CLASS framework.\n3. We establish a comprehensive evaluation protocol and conduct preliminary human evaluations of SPOCK and the synthetic scaffolding dataset with biology domain experts.\n4. We introduce a novel subproblem-augmented dual-retrieval technique, leveraging both main problem and subproblems, which enhances LLaMA\u2019s accuracy by 3.5% on the MMLU benchmark, surpassing traditional retrieval methods which focus solely on the main problem.\n5. We devise a thoughtfully designed response template for SPOCK to ensure consistency, clarity, and provide valuable insights into ITS internal decision-making process."

ITS can typically be divided into four categories (Feng et al., 2021): 1) tutoring dialoguebased ITS, such as AutoTutor (Graesser et al., 2004) which leverages natural language to identify student misconceptions; 2) constraint-based scaffolding modeling (Mitrovic et al., 2013), exemplified by KERMIT (Suraweera and Mitrovic, 2002), which utilizes predefined constraints written by human experts to address student inquiries; 3) Model tracing (Liu et al., 2022; Sonkar et al., 2020) which monitors student knowledge states to capture their problem-solving skills; 4) Bayesian network modeling (Corbett and Anderson, 1994) which expands model tracing using Bayesian networks.\nOur proposed framework CLASS incorporates the first two types of ITS, initially employing a scaffolding approach to break down problems into subproblems and then guiding students through the subproblems using natural language conversations. Additionally, instead of relying on laborintensive manual methods to develop scaffolding constraints, we utilize LLMs, which are already endowed with robust natural language understanding and question-answering abilities, to autonomously derive scaffolding strategies."

Recent advances in Natural Language processing have enabled the training of LLMs on a massive scale, such as GPT-4 (Bubeck et al., 2023) from OpenAI or PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) from Google. However, smaller language models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) from Meta, have also demonstrated competitive performance, offering an advantage of increased customizability, safer deployment and reduced costs. To our knowledge, the practice of training a custom language model for ITS remains under-explored, as most LLM-based ITS simply utilize APIs of LLMs with prompting strategy, which can restrict its scalability and impose a paywall.\nIn order to take the advantage of training custom language models for ITS, we use Vicuna-13b (Chiang et al., 2023), an open-source language model with 13 billion parameters, to develop SPOCK . An essential aspect of utilizing Vicuna model is the instruction-based training process (Ouyang et al., 2022), which allows the model to learn from explicit instructions provided during the fine-tuning stages. This instruction-based training enables SPOCK to better comprehend user intentions and then generate appropriate responses accordingly."

However, to effectively guide SPOCK to apply these skills seamlessly within realtime conversations, a different dataset is needed.\nThe second conversational dataset, also generated by GPT-4, includes simulated conversations between a student and an AI-powered Tutorbot, designed to help students using a question-centric approach. We carefully curate prompts to generate the following components for each conversation step:\n1. Problem: This field contains a question that the student needs help with. It is only generated in the first conversation step.\n2. Student\u2019s Message to Tutorbot: GPT-4 is prompted to act as a student and have a conversation with Tutorbot. In the prompt, we instruct GPT-4 to simulate both correct and incorrect responses as a student.\n3. Thoughts of Tutorbot: This field explains the Tutorbot\u2019s approach in assessing student responses and determining the appropriate category for providing suitable feedback. The decision-making process is based on the following situations: a) addressing incorrect responses, b) addressing correct responses, c) addressing partially correct responses, d) addressing ambiguous or unclear responses, e) redirecting off-topic responses, f) responding to student inquiries, g) guiding through subproblems, h) continuing the conversation if none of the above apply.\n4. Decision by Tutorbot: Based on the thought process and student\u2019s response, Tutorbot makes a decision and takes the corresponding actions. For example, when handling incorrect responses (category a), Tutorbot may decide to (a.1) promptly notify the student about the mistake, (a.2) provide constructive feedback to pinpoint the errors, (a.3) offer helpful hints to guide the student towards the correct solution, or (a.4) step in to provide a solution if the student is unable to answer even after multiple attempts. Multiple actions can be combined as needed to address the student\u2019s response effectively. All actions for each situation (a-h) are listed in Appendix A.2.\n5. Subproblem: This part specifies the subproblem being solved within the main problem, which helps the Tutorbot to keep track of the progress.\n6.

Focused on SPOCK\u2019s thought process and decision-making, this template ensures consistent and coherent engagement with students. It allows SPOCK to systematically address different student responses and inquiries. The Thoughts of Tutorbot field in the template, as described in\nthe previous section, includes different scenarios labeled from \u2018a\u2019 to \u2018h\u2019. SPOCK also incorporates the decisions made by selecting all applicable options from the thought process (labeled as \u2019a\u2019, \u2019b\u2019, \u2019c\u2019, etc.) as part of the response template output.\nAdopting this response template enhances the explainability and transparency of SPOCK\u2019s decisionmaking process. It offers insights into the rationale behind the model\u2019s choices, including the assessment of student responses and the resulting decisions the Tutorbot make. By leveraging the decision field, which encompasses both the evaluation of student responses and the subproblem, one can create a loss function that quantifies potential errors and inaccuracies in the SPOCK\u2019s responses. This iterative refinement approach ensures that SPOCK remains informed by real-world student interactions and steadily enhances its problem-solving and conversational capabilities. Hence, such response template could enable ITS to evolve continually, becoming more accurate and effective in providing step-by-step guidance."

            "text": "We introduce a novel retrieval technique that addresses a critical gap in existing retrieval methods. While conventional approaches focus solely on fetching relevant passages from educational content corresponding to the main problem, our technique goes a step further. It leverages the subproblems generated during simulated conversations, introducing a dual-layered retrieval process. This method significantly expands the scope of content retrieval and enhances the comprehensiveness of the information retrieved. To empirically validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments on the MMLU benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2020), focusing specifically on the \u2018College Biology\u2019 and \u2018High School Biology\u2019 subsets. The results were compelling as the initial application of our technique to the main problem demonstrated a notable improvement of 3% in LLaMA\u2019s accuracy. The integration of subproblems with the main problem further yielded an impressive 3.5% increase in accuracy. These findings unequivocally underscore the distinctive contribution of our dual-retrieval strategy. It\u2019s important to highlight that our approach not only enhances accuracy but also addresses a crucial aspect in educational support. By concurrently retrieving content relevant to both the main problem and its associated subproblems, we\nnot only ensure factual correctness in SPOCK\u2019s responses but also provide students with contextually relevant hints. This technique was simultaneously proposed by Radhakrishnan et al. (2023).\nOur indexing process begins with preprocessing of text-based educational resources, which includes tokenization and cleaning of the text and then extracting relevant paragraphs and sections. Next, these resources are indexed to create an efficient search structure, allowing for fast retrieval of relevant passages based on the input query, such as the subproblem field derived from the response template. The integration of the indexed search mechanism with SPOCK\u2019s response template empowers it to fetch relevant content when generating hints or providing feedback, ensuring that its responses are both factually accurate and contextually suitable. This approach adds an additional layer of validation to SPOCK\u2019s responses, contributing to an trustworthy learning experience for students."

            "text": "In this section, we provide the implementation details of SPOCK using proposed CLASS framework as a proof-of-concept. SPOCK is built upon a powerful 13 billion parameter Vicuna model (Chiang et al., 2023). Vicuna-13B is an open-source language model trained by fine-tuning the LLaMA model (Touvron et al., 2023) on 70K user-shared conversations collected from the ShareGPT website. We chose Vicuna-13B because of its ability to generate detailed and well-structured answers compared to other open-source language models, such as Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023). Additionally, Vicuna-13B has an Elo-rating of 1061 which is highest among the 13 billion open-source LLMs on LLM-as-a-judge Chatbot Arena (Zheng et al., 2023a).\nTo provide SPOCK with domain-specific knowledge, we further fine-tuned the Vicuna-13B model on 60 libretexts biology textbooks (Halpern, 2017) using the Causal Language Model (CLM) loss with the help of the huggingface transformers library (Wolf et al., 2020). This fine-tuning step aims to enhance SPOCK \u2019s understanding of biology concepts, as the Vicuna-13B model attains a relatively low score on the MMLU benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2020) when responding to questions in the STEM and social sciences domains.\nFollowing the CLM fine-tuning, we created the two datasets that form the backbone of the CLASS\nframework. We generated the scaffolding dataset by prompting GPT-4 to produce difficult problems within Bloom\u2019s taxonomy Levels 4-6 (Conklin, 2005). The problems are based on 648 learning objectives covering 207 sections across 47 chapters of the OpenStax Biology 2e textbook (Clark et al., 2021). This dataset contains 648 problems along with 2198 subproblems, hints, incorrect solutions, and feedback for each subproblem.\nNext, we created the conversational dataset by prompting GPT-4 to generate mock conversations between a student and an AI-Tutorbot by using the problems from the scaffolding dataset. This dataset contains 648 conversations summing up to a total of 20K student-tutorbot interactions. Average length of conversations is around 400 words, only including the student and tutorbot fields in the conversation template. Once the two datasets were generated, we further trained the Vicuna-13B model on both datasets with the help of the DeepSpeed (Rasley et al., 2020) and FastChat (Zheng et al., 2023b) libraries.\nThe cost of training SPOCK can be broken down into two primary components. First, the creation of both datasets involves prompting GPT-4, which costs approximately $50 each. Second, we train the model using the CLM loss on 60 biology textbooks and then fine-tune it on both scaffolding and conversational datasets for 10 epochs each. This process is executed on 8 NVIDIA RTX 48-GB A6000 GPUs and runs for three days. In summary, the implementation of SPOCK involves model selection, domain-specific fine-tuning, CLASS datasets generation, and further model fine-tuning."

All evaluation sessions with four SMEs was done virtually using video conferencing and each lasted between 90 to 120 minutes. SMEs selected three to five random biology sections from OpenStax biology book of their choice, followed by their interaction with SPOCK.\nDuring the call, SMEs were asked to engage in a \u201cthink out aloud testing protocol\". Thinking aloud is a concurrent verbalization of thoughts while performing a task (Ericsson, 2017) and has a long tradition in cognitive psychology and the field of education (Bannert, 2003; Kesler et al., 2016; Van de Vijver and Leung, 2021)."

We regularly ask questions related to each dimension to our SMEs, both during and at the end of their interaction with SPOCK. These criteria help us determine not only the accuracy of the information provided by SPOCK, but also its ability to guide students effectively through the problem-solving process.\nFactual Correctness The factual correctness of SPOCK is crucial to ensure that students receive accurate information while solving problems with help of SPOCK.\n\u2022 F1: Are the decisions (see Section 3.2) made by SPOCK accurate? These decisions reflect\nSPOCK\u2019s ability to access the correctness of student\u2019s responses.\n\u2022 F2: Are hints generated by SPOCK factually correct?\n\u2022 F3: Are the answers generated by SPOCK to students\u2019 questions factually correct?\nRelevancy Relevancy quantifies how helpful SPOCK\u2019s responses are to students when they encounter difficulties.\n\u2022 R1: Are generated subproblems (see Section 3.2) relevant to the question being asked?\n\u2022 R2: Are generated hints relevant or helpful when a student is stuck (provided the hints are factually correct)?\n\u2022 R3: Is this line of dialogue similar to what instructors generally use for explaining a concept?\nCompleteness This criteria ensures that all aspects of a question are addressed by SPOCK before it proceeds to the next question.\n\u2022 C1: Are all parts of an answer completed before the next question is asked?\n\u2022 C2: Are there guardrails for handling off-topic conversations? (C2 ensures that if a student engages in an off-topic conversation during conversation, SPOCK can redirect the topic back to the initial question raised by the student.)\nMotivation The motivation aspect of SPOCK assesses whether it successfully captures and maintains students\u2019 interest and attention throughout the learning process.\n\u2022 M1: Are the conversations engaging for students?\n\u2022 M2: Will these conversations not cause frustration for students? (M2 measures the area between successful engagement and total frustration.)"

            "text": "We conducted the first phase of evaluation following the evaluation protocol with four SMEs who possess extensive knowledge and expertise in biology. To guarantee a thorough assessment, each domain expert is instructed to emulate a student who is learning biology and will provide incorrect\nanswers, correct answers, irrelevant responses, and also occasionally request hints during the interaction. At the end of the evaluation, we give them the above questions and get a rating on a scale of 5 (1 \u2013 Poor, 2 \u2013 Fair, 3 \u2013 Good, 4 \u2013 Very Good, 5 \u2013 Excellent) along with their comments. Average of the ratings by the biology SMEs are reported in Table 2. We also include some interactions between the evaluators and SPOCK in Appendix B.3.\nTo elaborate on the results obtained from the evaluation process, all of the domain experts expressed positive feedback on the strategy of SPOCK where it breaks down a question into subproblems and gives step-by-step hints and responses to guide the students through the question. Additionally, they enjoyed the encouraging nature of SPOCK, which motivated students to persevere and engage with challenging biology concepts. They believe that positive reinforcement and supportive feedback from SPOCK could foster a conducive learning environment, boosting students\u2019 confidence and enthusiasm in their studies. Also, all domain experts agree that ITS like SPOCK can be useful learning aids for self-learning and they would prefer the interactive learning experience over reading books or simply browsing for answers. Potential use cases of SPOCK include but not limited to previewing for classes, consolidating unanswered or confused topics after class and preparing for quizzes and exams."

            "text": "The Conversational Learning with Analytical Stepby-Step Strategies (CLASS) framework revolutionizes ITS training with LLMs, equipping models with tutor-like step-by-step guidance and interactive conversational capabilities. SPOCK, our biology proof-of-concept ITS showcases the effectiveness of these capabilities. The CLASS framework utilizes two distinct training datasets and automated feedback for continual improvement of SPOCK. The scaffolding dataset imparts problemsolving strategies, while the conversational dataset enhances interactive skills with simulated student interactions. Our work contributes to the AI in education literature by laying the foundation for future ITS designs across various disciplines. We aim to address current limitations by conducting additional evaluation studies that encompass feedback from not only subject matter experts but also a diverse sample of students for a more comprehen-\nsive understanding of the ITS \u2019s impact. Furthermore, we plan to expand the scope of our research by exploring different subjects and improving the CLASS framework based on user feedback and experiences.\nLimitations\nAs one of the first to train custom language models for developing ITS , our proposed approach have some limitations. First, similar to most LLMs, it is difficult to consistently maintain factual accuracy in the generated responses to students. LLMs are prone to occasional inaccuracies and hallucinations, and these limitations are also inherited by our SPOCK built upon LLMs. To mitigate these issues, we proposed a novel indexed search technique over the educational content which significantly reduced concerns regarding factual accuracy. However, we acknowledge that additional guardrails are needed to further improve the accuracy of the returned information in future iterations of CLASS powered ITS. Second, SPOCK is not good at tasks involving numbers and mathematics, similar to many language models. A possible fix could be integrating SPOCK with algorithms designed for mathematical operations, which is subsequently proposed in Sonkar et al. (2023).\nEthics Statement\nIn the development of our research paper, we prioritize building privacy by design, ensuring that privacy safeguards are in place for learner interactions with the tutoring AI system from the outset. Recent incidents involving privacy breaches (Koetsier, 2023) and exposure of sensitive information (Mashable, 2023) in systems like GPT and BARD highlight the importance of transparency and trust in AI systems. Due to these concerns, we have chosen not to use GPT for our research, focusing instead on implementing our own model that proactively protects learner information from being fed back into a system that may inadvertently expose it for reidentification. By prioritizing privacy and data protection, we aim to create a secure and trustworthy learning environment for users engaging with our intelligent tutoring system."

    "abstractText": "The quality of texts generated by natural language generation (NLG) systems is hard to measure automatically. Conventional referencebased metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, have been shown to have relatively low correlation with human judgments, especially for tasks that require creativity and diversity. Recent studies suggest using large language models (LLMs) as reference-free metrics for NLG evaluation, which have the benefit of being applicable to new tasks that lack human references. However, these LLM-based evaluators still have lower human correspondence than medium-size neural evaluators. In this work, we present G-EVAL, a framework of using large language models with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and a form-filling paradigm, to assess the quality of NLG outputs. We experiment with two generation tasks, text summarization and dialogue generation. We show that G-EVAL with GPT-4 as the backbone model achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.514 with human on summarization task, outperforming all previous methods by a large margin. We also propose analysis on the behavior of LLM-based evaluators, and highlight the potential concern of LLM-based evaluators having a bias towards the LLM-generated texts. 1",

            "text": "Evaluating the quality of natural language generation systems is a challenging problem even when large language models can generate high-quality and diverse texts that are often indistinguishable from human-written texts (Ouyang et al., 2022). Traditional automatic metrics, such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), are widely used for NLG evaluation, but they have been shown to have relatively low correlation with human judgments, especially for open-ended generation tasks.\n1https://github.com/nlpyang/geval\nMoreover, these metrics require associated reference output, which is costly to collect for new tasks.\nRecent studies propose directly using LLMs as reference-free NLG evaluators (Fu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a). The idea is to use the LLMs to score the candidate output based on its generation probability without any reference target, under the assumption that the LLMs have learned to assign higher probabilities to high-quality and fluent texts. Meanwhile, it is becoming popular to use more powerful LLMs like GPT-4 to evaluate smaller or student models, like in Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) and Vicuna (Zheng et al., 2023). However, the validity and reliability of using LLMs as NLG evaluators have not been systematically investigated. In addition, meta-evaluations show that these LLMbased evaluators still have lower human correspondence than medium-size neural evaluators (Zhong et al., 2022). Thus, there is a need for a more effective and reliable framework for using LLMs for NLG evaluation.\nIn this paper, we propose G-EVAL, a framework of using LLMs with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) to evaluate the quality of generated texts in a form-filling paradigm. By only feeding the Task Introduction and the Evaluation Criteria as a prompt, we ask LLMs to generate a CoT of detailed Evaluation Steps. Then we use the prompt along with the generated CoT to evaluate the NLG outputs. The evaluator output is formatted as a form. Moreover, the probabilities of the output rating tokens can be used to refine the final metric. We conduct extensive experiments on three meta-evaluation benchmarks of two NLG tasks: text summarization and dialogue generation. The results show that G-EVAL can outperform existing NLG evaluators by a large margin in terms of correlation with human evaluations. Finally, we conduct analysis on the behavior of LLM-based evaluators, and highlight the potential issue of LLM-based evaluator having a bias towards the LLM-generated\ntexts. To summarize, our main contributions and findings in this paper are:\n1. G-EVAL generally outperforms referencebased and reference-free baseline metrics in terms of correlation with human quality judgments, especially for open-ended and creative NLG tasks, such as dialogue response generation.\n2. We propose to use automatic chain-of-thought to improve the performance of LLM-based evaluators by providing more context and guidance.\n3. We propose to re-weight the discrete scores by their respective token probabilities to provide a more fine-grained continuous score for GEVAL.\n4. We conduct an analysis of the potential issue that LLM-based metrics have a preference of LLM-generated texts over humanwritten texts, which may lead to the selfreinforcement of LLMs if LLM-based metrics are used as the reward signal for improving themselves."

            "text": "The chain-of-thoughts (CoT) is a sequence of intermediate representations that are generated by the LLM during the text generation process. For evaluation tasks, some criteria need a more detailed evaluation instruction beyond the simple definition, and it is time-consuming to manually design such evaluation steps for each task. We find that LLM can generate such evaluation steps by itself. The CoT can provide more context and guidance for the LLM to evaluate the generated text, and can also help to explain the evaluation process and results. For example, for evaluating coherence in text summarization, we add a line of \u201cEvaluation Steps:\" to the prompt and let LLM to generate the following CoT automatically:\n1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.\n2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it presents them in a clear and logical order.\n3. Assign a score for coherence on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.\nScoring Function The scoring function calls the LLM with the designed prompt, auto CoT, the input context and the target text that needs to be evaluated. Unlike GPTScore (Fu et al., 2023) which uses\nthe conditional probability of generating the target text as an evaluation metric, G-EVAL directly performs the evaluation task with a form-filling paradigm. This provides a more flexible way to evaluate the text as the model can behave directly based on the evaluation criteria and steps. For example, for evaluating coherence in text summarization, we concatenate the prompt, the CoT, the news article, and the summary, and then call the LLM to output a score from 1 to 5 for each evaluation aspect, based on the defined criteria.\nHowever, we notice this direct scoring function has two issues:\n1. For some evaluation tasks, one digit usually dominates the distribution of the scores, such as 3 for a 1 - 5 scale. This may lead to the low variance of the scores and the low correlation with human judgments.\n2. LLMs usually only output integer scores, even when the prompt explicitly requests decimal values. This leads to many ties in evaluation scores which do not capture the subtle difference between generated texts.\nTo address these issues, we propose using the\nprobabilities of output tokens from LLMs to normalize the scores and take their weighted summation as the final results. Formally, given a set of scores (like from 1 to 5) predefined in the prompt S = {s1, s2, ..., sn}, the probability of each score p(si) is calculated by the LLM, and the final score is:\nscore = n\u2211\ni=1\np(si)\u00d7 si (1)\nThis method obtains more fine-grained, continuous scores that better reflect the quality and diversity of the generated texts."

            "text": "Will G-EVAL prefer LLM-based outputs? One concern about using LLM as an evaluator is that it may prefer the outputs generated by the LLM itself, rather than the high-quality human-written texts. To investigate this issue, we conduct an experiment on the summarization task, where we compare the evaluation scores of the LLM-generated and the human-written summaries. We use the dataset collected in Zhang et al. (2023), where they first ask freelance writers to write high-quality summaries for news articles, and then ask annotators to compare human-written summaries and LLM-\ngenerated summaries (using GPT-3.5, text-davinci003).\nThe dataset can be divided in three categories: 1) human-written summaries that are rated higher than GPT-3.5 summaries by human judges, 2) human-written summaries that are rated lower than GPT-3.5 summaries by human judges, and 3) human-written summaries and GPT-3.5 summaries are rated equally good by human judges. We use GEVAL-4 to evaluate the summaries in each category, and compare the averaged scores. 2\nThe results are shown in Figure 2. We can see that, G-EVAL-4 assigns higher scores to humanwritten summaries when human judges also prefer human-written summaries, and assigns lower scores when human judges prefer GPT-3.5 summaries. However, G-EVAL-4 always gives higher scores to GPT-3.5 summaries than human-written\n2We use G-EVAL-4 in this experiment, because its superiority in evaluating summarization tasks. Although it has different distribution with with GPT-3.5, the two LLMs should share similar behaviors in terms of text generation.\nsummaries, even when human judges prefer humanwritten summaries. We propose two potential reasons for this phenomenon:\n1. NLG outputs from high-quality systems are in natural difficult to evaluate. The authors of the original paper found that inter-annotator agreement on judging human-written and LLM-generated summaries is very low, with Krippendorff\u2019s alpha at 0.07.\n2. G-EVAL may have a bias towards the LLMgenerated summaries because the model could share the same concept of evaluation criteria during generation and evaluation.\nOur work should be considered as a preliminary study on this issue, and more research is needed to fully understand the behavior of LLM-based evaluators to reduce its inherent bias towards LLMgenerated text. We highlight this concern in the context that LLM-based evaluators may lead to self-reinforcement of LLMs if the evaluation score is used as a reward signal for further tuning. And this could result in the over-fitting of the LLMs to their own evaluation criteria, rather than the true evaluation criteria of the NLG tasks.\nThe Effect of Chain-of-Thoughts We compare the performance of G-EVAL with and without chain-of-thoughts (CoT) on the SummEval benchmark. Table 1 shows that G-EVAL-4 with CoT has higher correlation than G-EVAL-4 without CoT on all dimensions, especially for fluency. This suggests that CoT can provide more context and guidance for the LLM to evaluate the generated text, and can also help to explain the evaluation process and results. And it is shown that CoT is more useful on consistency and fluency dimensions. We also provide results of G-EVAL with a simple prompting baseline on SummEval (only asking GPT-4 to score a summary from 1-5 on each dimension, without detailed task introduction, evaluation criteria and CoT).\nThe Effect of Probability Normalization We compare the performance of G-EVAL with and without probability normalization on the SummEval benchmark. Table 1 shows that, on KendallTau correlation, G-EVAL-4 with probabilities is inferior to G-EVAL-4 without probabilities on SummEval. We believe this is related to the calculation of Kendall-Tau correlation, which is based on the number of concordant and discordant pairs. Direct\nscoring without probabilities can lead to many ties, which are not counted as either concordant or discordant. This may result in a higher Kendall-Tau correlation, but it does not reflect the model\u2019s true capacity of evaluating the generated texts. On the other hand, probability normalization can obtain more fine-grained, continuous scores that better capture the subtle difference between generated texts. This is reflected by the higher Spearman correlation of G-EVAL-4 with probabilities, which is based on the rank order of the scores.\nThe Effect of Different LLMs We compare the performance of G-EVAL with different LLMs on the SummEval and QAGS benchmarks. Table 1 and Table 3 show that G-EVAL-4 has higher correlation than G-EVAL-3.5 on most dimensions and datasets, except for engagingness and groundedness on the Topical-Chat benchmark. This demonstrates that a better LLM can improve the performance of G-EVAL, especially for more challenging and complex evaluation tasks, such as consistency and relevance."

            "text": "Ngram-based Metrics Ngram-based metrics refer to the scores for evaluating the NLG models by measuring the lexical overlap between a generated text and a reference text. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is the most widely used metric for machine translation evaluation, which calculates the geometric mean of modified n-gram precision and a brevity penalty. ROUGE (Lin, 2004) is a recall-oriented metric for summarization evaluation, which measures the n-gram overlap between a generated summary and a set of reference summaries. It has been shown that more than 60% of recent papers on NLG only rely on ROUGE or BLEU to evaluate their systems (Kasai et al., 2022). However, these metrics fail to measure content quality (Reiter and Belz, 2009) or capture syntactic errors (Stent et al., 2005), and therefore do not reflect the reliability of NLG systems accurately.\nEmbedding-based Metrics Embedding-based metrics refer to the scores for evaluating the NLG models by measuring the semantic similarity between a generated text and a reference text based on the word or sentence embeddings. WMD (Kusner et al., 2015) is a metric that measures the distance between two texts based on the word embeddings. BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) measures\nthe similarity between two texts based on the contextualized embedding from BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019) improves BERTScore by adding soft alignments and new aggregation methods to obtain a more robust similarity measure. (Clark et al., 2019) propose a metric that evaluates multi-sentence texts by computing the similarity between the generated text and the reference text based on the sentence embeddings.\nTask-specific Evaluators Task-specific metrics refer to the scores for evaluating the NLG models by measuring the quality of the generated texts based on the specific task requirements. For example, summarization tasks need to assess the consistency of the generated summaries (Krys\u0301cin\u0301ski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Durmus et al., 2020), and dialogue response generation tasks need to assess the coherence of the generated responses (Dziri et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2021; Ghazarian et al., 2019). However, these metrics are not generalizable to other NLG tasks, and they are not able to measure the overall quality of the generated texts.\nUnified Evaluators Recently, some evaluators have been developed to assess text quality from multiple dimensions by varying the input and output contents (Yuan et al., 2021) or the model variants (Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020) they use. UniEval (Zhong et al., 2022) is a unified evaluator that can evaluate different aspects of text generation as QA tasks. By changing the question format, it can handle different evaluation tasks.\nLLM-based Evaluators Fu et al. (2023) propose GPTScore, a new framework that evaluated texts with generative pre-training models like GPT-3. It assumes that a generative pre-training model will assign a higher probability of high-quality generated text following a given instruction and context. Wang et al. (2023a) conduct a preliminary survey of using ChatGPT as a NLG evaluator. Kocmi and Federmann (2023); Lu et al. (2023) proposed to use GPT models for evaluating machine translation tasks. Very recently, Wang et al. (2023b) investigated the problem of unfairness when using large models in evaluating dialogue responses."

This may limit the applicability and reproducibility of G-EVAL. Moreover, the LLMs are constantly updated, which may lead to inconsistent evaluation results across different versions of the LLMs.\n3. We meta-evaluate G-EVAL on two NLG tasks, text summarization and dialogue generation.

    "abstractText": "In Chinese studies, understanding the nuanced traits of historical figures, often not explicitly evident in biographical data, has been a key interest. However, identifying these traits can be challenging due to the need for domain expertise, specialist knowledge, and context-specific insights, making the eprocess time-consuming and difficult to scale. Our focus on studying officials from China\u2019s Ming Dynasty is no exception. To tackle this challenge, we propose MingOfficial, a large-scale multi-modal dataset consisting of both structured (career records, annotated personnel types) and text (historical texts) data for 13, 031 officials. We further couple the dataset with a graph neural network (GNN) to combine both modalities in order to allow investigation of social structures and provide features to boost down-stream tasks. Experiments show that our proposed MingOfficial could enable exploratory analysis of official identities, and also significantly boost performance in tasks such as identifying nuance identities (e.g. civil officials holding military power) from 24.6% to 98.2% F1 score in holdout test set. By making MingOfficial publicly available at https://data.depositar.io/ en/dataset/ming_official as both a dataset and an interactive tool, we aim to stimulate further research into the role of social context and representation learning in identifying individual characteristics, and hope to provide inspiration for computational approaches in other fields beyond Chinese studies.",

Techniques such as prosopography, which systematically collates all relevant biographical data, have been employed to\nThe numbers following the author names indicate their order of authorship.\nCCorresponding author. Email: thtsai@g.ncu.edu.tw\nexamine shared histories of past groups or individuals (Stone, 1971; Verboven et al., 2007; Lunding et al., 2020). Recently with the trend of digital humanities, databases such as CBDB (Harvard Uni-\nversity et al., 2019) have brought a transformative shift in this field, offering scholars and historians a more flexible approach to studying Chinese political figures (Tsui and Wang, 2020). These databases allows answering queries like \u201cWho entered government through the civil examination from Jiangnan region during the Hongzhi reign (1487-1505)?\u201d and have proven useful for studying officials in China\u2019s Ming Dynasty, which is our focus in Chinese study.\nHowever, identifying nuanced characteristics not explicitly presented in biographical data remains challenging. For example, the possession of military power by civil officials \u2014 an official with a position in the War Ministry (\u5175\u90e8), a department overseeing military administration (Hucker, 1998), in the career record does not necessarily having military power unless textual record suggests military campaigns under the official\u2019s command. Identifying these cases often requires specialized knowledge and contextual understanding. Undoubtedly, such process is time-consuming.\nTo tackle this challenge, we hypothesize that alongside career records, an approach considering social relations among civil officials along with their notable activities described in records, would provide much needed insights. In doing so, we propose MingOfficial, a large-scale multi-modal dataset consisting of two modalities: (1) structured data, the career records of 13, 031 Ming dynasty officials, reflecting their political standing and social prestige, and (2) textural data, 69, 688 paragraphs from the records in Ming Shi Lu (\u660e\u5be6\u9304, or Imperial Annals of Ming Dynasty), documenting major activities an official participated in. This data, organized into a graph structure, is coupled with graph neural networks (GNN) (Scarselli et al., 2009) to embed historical context and social dynamics into a lower-dimensional space, enhancing downstream tasks.\nWe empirically analyze the dataset and apply it to down-stream tasks. The dataset in its vanilla form already could reflect the changing power dynamics over time and shows the latent social relations among officials. Furthermore, our graph neural network model enhances the identification of nuanced traits, boosting the F1 score from 24.6% to 98.2% in distinguishing civil officials with military power. This substantial improvement is achieved despite being trained on a mere 6% of labeled data, composed of only 49 instances, with just 8 positive\ncases. This demonstrates the practicality of our approach for tasks identifying character traits, which often require costly annotations entailing meticulous reading of scattered historical records about an individual.\nThe potential of MingOfficial extends beyond its historical implications. It serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for numerous research fields, including network analysis, sociological studies, computational linguistics, and natural language processing. It also provides valuable insights into the Ming dynasty\u2019s political and social dynamics, forming a strong foundation for comparative historical and political studies. Our contributions are the following:\n\u2022 We are the first to use both career records and relevant textual content to represent past political figures.\n\u2022 We introduce MingOfficial, a dataset that includes Ming dynasty officials\u2019 career records, position categories, annotated personnel types, and related historical texts, providing a deep understanding of the political network and governmental system of Eastern institutions.\n\u2022 We propose to learn the representation of Ming officials using graph neural network, fully exploiting the rich, interconnected information in MingOfficial.\n\u2022 We apply these representations to identify nuanced characteristics, using the military power of civil officials as an example, and offer annotation guidelines for future research. Our approach establishes a foundation for future research to further uncover intricate characteristics of past political figures."

Correctly identifying these individuals re-\nquires deep domain knowledge and an extensive understanding of the historical backdrop of the Ming Dynasty.\nFor example, Yu Qian (\u4e8e\u8b19), a civil official whose career records are presented in Figure 1, held a significant position in the War Ministry (Hucker, 1998). Merely having such a role does not unequivocally imply military power, as the ministry mainly dealt with logistics, personnel, finances, and infrastructure rather than active commanding. However, historical accounts, as in Figure 1, provide context showing that Yu Qian was tasked with arranging the army to protect the capital during a war event, thus suggesting his military power."

Given the variance in descriptions of identical positions, we organize these records into 123 categories according to Da Ming Hui Dian (\u5927 \u660e\u6703\u5178, or The Code of the Ming Dynasty) and Chinese-English Dictionary of Ming Government Official Titles (Zhang et al., 201). This categorization reflects the administrative structure of the Ming government, grouping titles of core officials and subordinates from different departments into office categories, facilitating the conversion of career information into a graph structure. Examples of this categorization are available in Appendix A.\nEach official\u2019s personnel type is inferred from the position categories in their career records, with five groups: civil officials, military officers, eunuchs, imperial family members, and others. Figure 2 (a) shows the personnel types distribution among all Ming officials, with civil officials forming the majority within the office system. Note that our method effectively handles such imbalanced labels, as demonstrated in Section 4.\nTextual Data We source related texts from Ming Shi Lu (\u660e\u5be6\u9304, or Imperial Annals of Ming Dynasty), a collection of thirteen historical books by Ming officials, available at Academia Sinica (2019). These documents cover the reigns of the thirteen Ming Emperors, from the Hongwu Emperor (\u6d2a\n\u6b66\u5e1d, 1368-1398) to the Chongzhen Emperor (\u5d07 \u798e\u5e1d, 1627-1644). They include imperial edicts, laws, and major political, economic, and cultural events, serving as a fundamental resource for Ming history research.\nWe first process the texts in Ming Shi Lu using named entity recognition (Lai, 2016) and named entity disambiguation (Wu, 2021) to identify people, location names, and official titles in the text. We then select only the paragraphs in which a person entity is linked to an official. As a result, we obtained a total of 69,688 processed texts. The number of processed texts each year is shown in Figure 2b, and a breakdown by each emperor is detailed in Appendix B."

The process we developed, grounded in historical context, could generalize to modern scenarios. It serves as a model for identifying specific characteristics in complex social networks.\nWe determine a civil official\u2019s military power based on evidence from primary historical sources. These sources include Ming Shi Lu, Ming Shi (\u660e \u53f2, or History of Ming), and the Military System subdivisions of the Economic series in Gujin Tushu Jicheng (\u53e4\u4eca\u5716\u66f8\u96c6\u6210, or Imperial Encyclopaedia). Officials are identified as having military power if they meet one or more of the following\ncriteria: (1) Personally leading soldiers to the battlefield, (2) Commanding troops and (3) Arranging the personnel in the military.\nShould a source paragraph detail military engagements, be they wars or rebellions, we deem the associated official to hold military power, based on the given criteria. Consider Figure 3 as an illustration: it depicts Wang Shou Ren (also known as \u738b\u5b88\u4ec1 or\u738b\u967d\u660e), a civilian authority, mobilizing troops to suppress a rebellion. This narrative provides clear evidence of his military prowess.\nTo assess the reliability of our annotations, we employ Cohen\u2019s kappa measure (Cohen, 1960) for inter-annotator agreement (IAA) (Artstein, 2017). This assessment involves 100 sampled civil officials from MingOfficial. Our annotators, proficient in literary Chinese and knowledgeable in history and humanities, included an author of the paper(A) and two individuals (B and C) not involved in criteria development. Table 1 shows their substantial agreement, validating the reliability of our approach."

At each step, after updating the official embeddings with text embeddings using the P-T relation, officials with the top-k Cosine similarity between their embeddings form the simP-P relationship, signifying similarities in their experiences as inferred from texts. Except for coP-P, all relationships are delineated by reign periods, marking the temporal aspect of an official\u2019s activity or relationships.\nWe initiate the nodes embedding as follow. For T, we use the CLS sentence embeddings generated by the pretrained BERT-based-Chinese model (Devlin et al., 2019), while for P and O, we use the metapath2vec model (Dong et al., 2017) that samples path to reflect the administrative structure of the Ming governmental institutions (see Figure 5)."

The model\u2019s objective is to classify officials from the Ming Dynasty into three major political groups: civil officials, military officers, or eunuchs. It relies on analyzing their career records, with a central emphasis on P-O, encompassing all their held official positions. The model employs GNN to aggregate information from O to P through P-O. Following this, we feed the embedding of P (represented as pi) into a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) with softmax (f ) to predict the personnel type ci. Cross entropy loss is used:\nLPT = \u2212 \u2211 i\u2208Sofc log f(ci|pi) (1)\nf(c|p) = Softmax(Wcp+ bc) (2) where Sofc is the set of officials for Stage 1, Wc and bc are learnable parameter of the FFNN.

Overall, this graph showcases the dynamic power shifts between the three major political groups over time. In particular, it provides a preliminary explana-\ntion of the phenomena whereby military officers were heavily relied upon in the early Ming dynasty, and how the power in military discourse gradually shifted towards civil officials and eunuchs during the middle period.\nThen we we construct co-occurrence networks based on the person mentions in texts, and show in Figure 7 the complex and changing social relations spanning across the reigns of two different emperors.

We experiment with various settings for these models and present their performance as F1\nscore for CO w/ MP in Table 3.\nEfficacy of Graph Structure with GNN All GNN models consistently outperform the baseline MLP model by a significant margin. This notable improvement is evident despite the GNN models being trained for only 4 epochs, compared to the 20 epochs for the MLP model. These results underline the effectiveness of our graph-based approach in generating high-quality individual representations.\nImpact of Incorporting Textual Data We found that integrating textual data, specifically official narratives, significantly enhances the model\u2019s performance. This trend is consistent across both the MLP and GNN models. For the MLP model, the use of text embeddings resulted in better performance than models without them. For GNN models, those incorporating coP-P or(and) simPP along with P-O generally outperform those using P-O alone. The only exception to this trend was observed with SAGE, where P-O + coP-P per-\nforms worse than P-O alone. We attribute this to SAGE\u2019s lack of an attention mechanism which could weigh the importance of the relatively coarse co-occurrence relations. In contrast, GAT and HGT, with their attention mechanisms, can more effectively leverage coP-P.\nComparison between coP-P and simP-P Across all GNN models, the combination of P-O + simP-P consistently achieved the highest scores. Particularly, SAGE and GAT showed considerable improvements when using P-O + simP-P as opposed to P-O + coP-P (SAGE: +17.7%, GAT: + 8.0%). In contrast, HGT showed only a marginal increase. We also experimented with the incorporation of both coP-P and simP-P, which improved the performance of SAGE and GAT compared to P-O + coP-P. However, this setting negatively impacted the performance of HGT. Given that HGT treats the graph as a heterogeneous entity with different attention layers for various types of nodes, we hypothesize that it might require additional training time and data for model optimization.\nBest Performance and Training Efficiency Notably, GAT achieves the most stable and highest F1 score of 98.2% for CO w/ MP under the setting of P-O + simP-P. This outstanding performance was achieved on a small training set of only 49 examples and with 4 training epochs, highlighting the efficiency of our approach. This finding is particularly important as it suggests the potential to significantly reduce annotation labor in future applications."

In some cases, the model incorrectly predicted these characteristics based on seemingly similar career trajectories.\n\u2022 Sparse individual information consistently caused false negatives across all settings. The need for enriched datasets or additional data\nsources is apparent to enhance accuracy when data is limited.\n\u2022 Direct evidence of military power in related narratives significantly improved prediction accuracy, particularly when using P-O + simPP. This underscores the importance of integrating text-based evidence.\n\u2022 Abundant co-occurrence relations can sometimes introduce noise, leading to inaccurate predictions. This was particularly evident in cases where officials had numerous related texts, but the co-occurrence did not necessarily indicate the presence of military power. This indicates the need for careful management of such relations in future models."

We hypothesize this effectiveness might be due to the similarity between the writing style of the Ming Dynasty historical texts and contemporary Chinese. Additionally, since our task is more on similarity and co-occurrence, we think that a large enough pretrained model such as BERT-base-chinese can produce satisfactory results. We envision that a large language model that can properly be trained on both Modern and Classical Chinese would benefit study in this kind.\nMore Effective Way to Fuse coP-P and simP-P Interactions We suspect the decreased performance when using both types of relations comes from the long text spans in coP-P relations. Given that these relations are drawn from entire paragraphs, there might be a weak connection between a person mentioned at the beginning and those mentioned at the end of a long paragraph. We hypothesize that using shorter text spans, like sentences, might work better and reduce noise. However, segmenting the paragraphs into sentences is a challenge in our case because the original records, like most Classical Chinese texts, lack punctuation marks which poses a segmentation challenge, and during our research, we haven\u2019t identified a tool that could efficiently address this challenge. We think that future research will look into better ways to combine these P-P interactions, and we\u2019ll leave this as a challenge for future study."

Liu et al. (2015), Lai (2016), Yan et al. (2020), and Liu et al. (2021) employ the information in biographical databases to annotate texts, and use the annotated texts to train a language model for a named entity recognition task \u2014 identifying persons, locations, and official titles. Armand and Henriot (2021) and Zhang et al. (2021) further use these identified entities to construct a latent social network based on co-occurrence of person names. Several works also explore the correspondence network (Weerdt et al., 2016), kinship network (Liu and Wang, 2017), and career trajectory network (Xiong, 2021).\nGraph Neural Network (GNN) and Representation Learning GNN utilizes graph structures for message passing, a process that aggregates a node\u2019s local neighborhood information and update the node\u2019s representation. Notable GNN architectures have been proposed. Kipf and Welling (2017) propose graph convolutional network (GCN), facilitating efficient message passing and aggregation between neighbors. Hamilton et al. (2018) propose GraphSAGE, an inductive framework using local neighbor sampling and various aggregations operators including mean, LSTM and pooling. Velic\u030ckovic\u0301 et al. (2018) propose graph attention network (GAT), incorporating attention mechanism into GNNs and allowing different weights for nodes within the same neighborhood. Hu et al. (2020b) propose heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT), employing meta relations in heterogeneous graphs to parameterize shared weight matrices for generalization and integrates with transformer-like attention architecture.\nSuch GNNs have been utilized in contemporary political figure representation learning. For instance, (Mou et al., 2021) and (Feng et al., 2022)\nhave applied GNNs to jointly model legislators and learn representations, incorporating voting behavior and public statements or leveraging information from Wikipedia and think tanks, respectively.\nOur proposed dataset and method differs from these related work in that we propose to jointly model the officials, the events from both structured and textual data, and leverage representation learning with a graph neural network (GNN) to identify nuanced characteristics of past officials, thus giving a comprehensive view of historical figures not seen before. Additionally, the textual data features a high volume of co-occurrence ties and latent associations, which can be further leveraged to investigate the interpersonal relationships and political subgroups among past officials. Lastly, our approach also unveils text-based evidence that substantiates the identified nuanced characteristics."

            "text": "In this work, we introduce a dataset, derived from career records of the officials in the Ming Dynasty and their relevant historical texts in Ming Shi Lu (\u660e \u5be6\u9304, or Imperial Annals of Ming Dynasty). Our MingOfficial dataset captures the dynamic social structures among officials throughout the reigns of various Ming emperors. In addition, we took the first step to study the officials in the past with a graph-based representation learning approach.\nOur proposed method underscores the potential of integrating the literary context of historical research in a less direct yet effective manner. Instead of depending heavily on the straightforward interpretation of the contextual meaning of historical research, this approach allows for an indirect understanding through relationships that are much easier to extract from the text. This method addresses a significant challenge: minimizing the dependency on labor-intensive interpretation while integrating the rich context from historical texts.\nExperiments shows that our approach can learn effective representation to discern nuanced characteristics of individuals such as civil official\u2019s military power in the Ming Dynasty, despite being trained on only 49 labeled instances, with just 8 positive cases. This finding highlights the potential to significantly reduce annotation labor in future applications\nDespite the advancements achieved, several potential research areas remain unexplored due to the study\u2019s focused scope, which we earmark for\nfuture work. For example, we envision a future extension on extracting local-scale, fine-grained relationships between officials in targeted groups that are not explicitly documented in historical documents. Another prospective extension is applying our approach to other historical studies, such as examining other governmental systems (for instance, the Byzantine Empire) with complex and multimodal historical recordings. Lastly, we foresee opportunities in leveraging our approach to facilitate various other domains, like sociology and political science, thereby further broadening the applicability and impact of our research.\nLimitations\nDespite the demonstrated efficacy of our proposed method in identifying nuanced characteristics within a group of people, there are notable limitations. Firstly, our approach has not been contrasted with other potential methods for identifying target groups. This lack of comparative analysis is primarily due to the scarcity of related work in the field, including no other publicly available datasets that align with MingOfficial\u2019s characteristics.\nWe consider our present effort as an initial demonstration, a proof of concept that paves the way for more extensive research endeavors in the future. While our current approach was tested on a single dataset, it holds potential for wider applications across diverse datasets. To provide more context, our approach is well-suited for probing historical documents like Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty (\u671d\u9bae\u738b\u671d\u5be6\u9304), Veritable Records of Qing (\u6e05\u5be6\u9304), and Chorography (\u5730 \u65b9\u8a8c). Beyond that, we can also delve into contemporary archives, especially those that highlight local intricacies and interpersonal dynamics, such as records from Taiwan\u2019s Legislature and Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative Council. We believe that our current work is just the beginning. It lays the groundwork for wider and more diverse research down the road.\nAdditionally, a significant drawback of our method is the limited interpretability of our GNN models. The specifics of how the model draws predictions from the data provided in the MingOfficial dataset remain unknown. A more transparent understanding of which career records or official relations significantly contribute to the model\u2019s predictions would greatly aid researchers in the field. However, such exploration extends beyond the scope of our current study and is a focus for future work.\nFurthermore, our study is constrained by the quality and scope of our data. As with many historical databases, our MingOfficial dataset might contain inaccuracies and omissions that could affect our results. Moreover, the data is confined to the Ming Dynasty, limiting the generalizability of our findings to other historical periods or cultures. The scalability of our method also remains untested. Although our approach proves effective for the present dataset, its performance with significantly larger datasets or different time frames remains uncertain.\nLastly, our research relies on certain assumptions, including the presumption that all significant characteristics and relationships are captured by the database and textual records. If these assumptions fail, our method might overlook key aspects influencing an official\u2019s acquisition of military power. Future work can address these limitations by testing our method on more comprehensive and diverse datasets, as well as exploring mechanisms for model interpretability and validation for assumptions."

Our initial analysis illustrates the dataset\u2019s ability to trace the historical shifts in power among major political groups. We aim to observe the changing prominence of civil officials, military officers, and eunuchs throughout the Ming Dynasty.\nWe employed a term frequency-document frequency (tf-df) calculation, inspired by the numerical statistic term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) (Sparck Jones, 1988), where a term corresponds to an office,\ntfdf(t, d,Dy) = tf(t, d) \u2217 df(t,Dy) (5)\nwhere the term frequency tf(t, d) is the frequency of term within a record, df(t,Dy) is a measure of how much influence an office provides within a year\ntf(t, d) = ft,d (6)\ndf(t,Dy) = log\n( |d \u2208 Dy : t \u2208 d|\nN\n) (7)\nwith t = office mention, d = record, Dy = set of records with in year y, and N = |Dy|. In practice, df(t,D) is computed as:\nlog\n( |d \u2208 Dy : t \u2208 d|\nN + 1\n) + 1 (8)\nInstead of incorporating the inverse document frequency to diminish the frequency of terms that not only frequently occur in a record but also frequently in all of the records within a year, we compute the document frequency to strengthen it. We reason that the more occurrence of an office in multiple records, the more important an office is in the year. To observe the change in importance of different offices over time, we rank each office in a record by tf-df and count the total number of times each office ranks first by year.\nThe result, displayed in Figure 6, reveals a significant trend: in the early Ming, military officers had significant influence. However, by the late 15th century, the status of civil officials gradually improved and eventually surpassed the others. Moreover, eunuchs also held considerable influence during certain periods.\nOverall, this graph showcases the dynamic power shifts between the three major political groups over time. In particular, it provides a preliminary explanation of the phenomena whereby military officers were heavily relied upon in the early Ming dynasty, and how the power in military discourse gradually shifted towards civil officials and eunuchs during the middle period. This insight suggests that the MingOfficial dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the evolving power dynamics in the Ming dynasty. Detailed analysis of these trends is left as future work.\nInsight 2: MingOfficial Preserves the Intricate Social Relations among Officials. To further demonstrate the dataset\u2019s capacity for depicting complex social relations, we construct cooccurrence networks based on the person mentions\nin texts and visualize the network with Gephi (Bastian et al., 2009), a network analysis tool. Figure 7 present these networks, which span across the reigns of two different emperors from 1449 to 1451. Yu Qian is prominently featured in both (highlighted with a red circle). The distinct communities within the network are indicated by node colors, as detected by the Louvain method built into Gephi. Text colors within nodes represent different personnel types: blue for\ncivil officials, purple for military officers, green for eunuchs, and orange for the imperial family. The depicted variations in network structures between the two periods offer unique insights into the dynamics of interpersonal relationships and social structures over time.\nIn summary, the MingOfficial dataset serves as a potent resource for exploring not only individual biography and prosopography, but also broader social dynamics such as class, mobility, and political networks. Our examination of potential associations and network changes underscore the intricate social interactions preserved within the dataset, emphasizing its value for historical and sociological studies."

            "text": "In this section, we will give a brief overview of the governmental system in the Ming dynasty and the interaction of officials operating within it.\nD.1 The Ming Government System\nThe governmental system matured in the Ming times is the culmination of the development of the bureaucratic system in the previous dynasties, generally regarded as the epitome of the bureaucratic system in Chinese history (Hucker, 1958). The organization of the system has three tiers in general. The top tier comprises 10 clusters of government offices in the central government, the second has 48 clusters of government agencies, and the third has 230 departments (Zhang et al., 201). Besides abolishing a few top-tier political institutions in the central government to concentrate power in his own hands, the founding emperor of the Ming dynasty (1368-1398), Zhu Yuanzhang, also established new government organs according to the social and political needs of the time, forming an organizational structure \u201clargely perpetuated with admiration by the succeeding Ching dynasty (Hucker, 1998).\u201d\nD.2 The Interplay of the Political Groups in the Ming Government\nThree major political groups operated within the Ming government \u2014 civil officials, military officers, and eunuchs. The Ming emperors adopted a few measures to prevent one group from superimposing the others.\nTo limit the power of the military officers and institutions, the Ming emperors separated the military leaders from their soldiers by keeping the military\nleadership \u2014 the authority to manage and command the troops \u2014 under the control of a small number of high-ranking civil officials. (Filipiak, 2012) As the civil officials are thoroughly indoctrinated in the ritual and principles of good government written in the Confucian literature, they were less likely to challenge the imperial power, thus strengthening the military governance by the emperor. (Zhang, 2011; Robinson, 2017) Moreover, to alleviate the tension between the Ming emperors, and the civil officials and military officers, eunuchs were also assigned to various influential tactical military positions. (Li, 2018) As time progressed, these measures created tension between the three groups, contributing to the country\u2019s ills and hastening the decline of the Ming dynasty."

            "heading": "E Resource-intensive Annotation for Determining Civil Officials\u2019 Military Power",
            "text": "Determining whether a civil official had actual military power during their career is a complex task that requires a significant investment of time and resources. The process cannot solely rely on career records in the database of names and biographies (\u4eba\u540d\u6b0a\u5a01\u4eba\u7269\u50b3\u8a18\u8cc7\u6599\u5eab)(IHP), as these records often lack sufficient detail. For instance, while many Ministers of War led armies in battle, this was not a uniform practice across all reigns during the Ming Dynasty.\nGiven these challenges, the process for making reliable annotations involves a detailed examination of an official\u2019s career trajectory, changes in their roles, and any evidence of their exercising military authority. This extensive process includes:\n\u2022 Conducting in-depth reviews and studies of a wide range of historical literature.\n\u2022 Verifying evidence by cross-referencing various historical sources.\n\u2022 Performing rigorous historical analyses.\nThis procedure requires both expertise in the subject matter and a considerable investment of time. For this study, the development of the annotation guideline and the annotation of civil officials with military power took us approximately three months.\nF Implementation Details for Official Representation Learning\nF.1 Node Initialization We encode the texts with the an open-source weight of Chinese BERT model (cki) and Hugging-face (Wolf et al., 2020) framework , yielding an initial embedding dimension of 768 for text nodes. We then implemented the metapath2vec model with PyTorch-Geometric (Fey and Lenssen, 2019) to produce a 64 dimension representation with following settings: walk length at 40, context size at 8, walks per node at 20, number of negative samples at 1, The model was trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 32.\nThe initial official position embeddings, visualized in Figure 10, illustrates that official positions within the same offices (points of identical colors) cluster together, signifying that the official position embeddings effectively represents the administrative structure of the Ming Dynasty.\nF.2 Model Implementation and Hyperparameters\nWe implemented GNN and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) models using PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and PyTorch-Geometric. All models use Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014), with \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.999, \u03f5 = 1e\u2212 08, and a batch size 8.\nThe MLP model, with a learning rate set to 1e \u2212 3, took as input a concatenation of the official\u2019s own representation and the averaged representations of the position (office) and/or text re-\nlated to the official. It consisted of a normalization layer followed by two projection layers, predicting whether the civil official held military power.\nFor GNN models, we use a learning rate of 1e\u22124 for stage 1, and 1e\u2212 3 for stage 2. We set k = 20 for constructing the simP-P relation. The models consisted of 2 layers with a hidden-layer dimension of 128. Specifically, for HGT and GAT models, we set the number of attention heads to 4. Dropout and early stopping strategies were employed to prevent overfitting. The specific number of training epochs is given in Table 3.\nF.3 Handling Class Imbalance\nAs shown in Table 2, our dataset suffered from extreme class imbalance. To address this, we utilized an imbalanced sampler implemented in PyTorchGeometric (Fey and Lenssen, 2019) in both stages of representation learning (see 3.2). In stage 1, we upsampled the eunuch and military officer sets to match the number of civil officials. In stage 2, we upsampled the set of civil officials with military power to equal the number of civil officials without military power. This sampling process was applied to both our training and validation sets."

            "heading": "G Error Analysis",
            "text": "We conducted an error analysis on the best performing GNN model \u2013 GAT, and extracted several important findings. Confusion matrices for the prediction results under different settings are displayed in Figure 8.\nIdentification of Nuanced Characteristics, like Military Power Among Civil Officials, is Insufficient with Merely Career Records. The GAT model, despite its strong performance across all settings in predicting Civil Officials without Military Power (CO w/o MP), incorrectly predicts five false positives when relying only on P-O. These false positives, as exemplified by Zhang Ben (\u5f35\n\u672c) in Table 6, depict career trajectories that resemble those of CO w/ MP. They hold positions often associated with military power, such as Grand Coordinator (\u5de1\u64ab), Supreme Commander (\u7e3d\u7763), Military Superintendent (\u63d0\u7763), Minister of War (\u5175\u90e8\u5c1a\u66f8), Vice Commander-in-chief (\u5354\u7406\u4eac\u71df \u620e\u653f), Officers Provincial in the Administration Commission (\u627f\u5ba3\u5e03\u653f\u76f8\u95dc\u8077\u54e1), and Officers in the Censorate (\u90fd\u5bdf\u9662\u76f8\u95dc\u8077\u54e1). We conjecture that this similarity leads model to erroneous predictions.\nHowever, the model\u2019s performance improved considerably when it incorporated additional person-to-person information, such as co-occurring positions (coP-P), similarity of individual embeddings (simP-P), or both. Consequently, false positives for CO w/o MP were effectively eradicated. This outcome highlights the inadequacy of relying solely on career records to discern nuanced characteristics, such as military power among civil officials.\nNotably, true positive predictions using P-O were associated with an average of 23.7 career records, compared to a mere average of 7.5 records for false negatives. This discrepancy underscores the potential value of comprehensive career records in enhancing model accuracy, particularly when the data is confined to career records alone.\nSparse Information on Individuals Inhibits Accurate Predictions. Across all four settings, the\nmodel consistently misclassified three specific individuals as false negatives. These individuals had limited data, with no more than two career records and between one and five related texts. Furthermore, none of these texts presented direct evidence of the individuals possessing Military Power (MP). This finding emphasizes the need for abundant individual-level information to ensure accurate predictions. Therefore, enriching the dataset or leveraging additional data sources might enhance prediction accuracy when the available data is limited.\nDirect Evidence of Military Power in Related Narratives Enhances SimP-P Efficacy. Examining the true positive predictions made using official positions and individual embedding similarity (P-O + simP-P) revealed that related texts often supplied direct evidence of the officials having military power, especially when other settings (P-O, P-O + coP-P) fell short. An illustrative example includes a narrative stating, \"Supervising Secretary Dai Bain (\u6234\u5f01) and six others who were decreed to be stationed at the border. (\u7d66\u4e8b\u4e2d\u6234\u5f01\u7b49\u4e03\u4eba \u5404\u8cdc\u66f0\u723e\u7b49\u5206\u908a).\", confirming Dai Bain (\u6234\u5f01)\u2019s military power. This evidence substantiates the effectiveness of simP-P in deriving meaningful associations from textual content, further highlighting the added value of integrating text-based evidence into predictive tasks.\nAbundant Co-occurrence Relations Could Introduce Noise. A clear manifestation of this issue arises in three instances of false negative predictions observed under the settings of P-O + coP-P + simP-P, P-O + coP-P, and P-O alone. Two of these erroneous predictions involve Liu Jingshao (\u5289\u666f \u97f6) and Song Ying-Chang (\u5b8b\u61c9\u660c), each with fewer than three career records. The third case, Sun Yunzhong(\u5b6b\u5141\u4e2d), possesses six career records, but significantly deviates from a typical CO w/ MP, as demonstrated in Table 7. The model\u2019s incorrect predictions under the P-O alone setting can be attributed to these atypical career records.\nHowever, the P-O + coP-P + simP-P configuration presents a different problem, as the model still fails to predict correctly despite the availability of related texts that provide direct evidence of MP. This issue is exemplified by Song Ying Chang\u2019s cooccurrence network (Figure 13). Despite militaryrelated narratives present in Song Ying Chang\u2019s textual data (Figure 12), an overload of co-occurrence relations introduced by coP-P causes the model to overlook his military power. This underscores the need for future models to employ more refined management or filtering of co-occurrence relations, in order to minimize noise and improve predictive accuracy."

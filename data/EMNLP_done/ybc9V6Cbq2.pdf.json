    "abstractText": "In this study, we highlight the importance of enhancing the quality of pretraining data in multilingual language models. Existing web crawls have demonstrated quality issues, particularly in the context of low-resource languages. Consequently, we introduce a new multilingual pretraining corpus for 16 African languages, designed by carefully auditing existing pretraining corpora to understand and rectify prevalent quality issues. To compile this dataset, we undertake a rigorous examination of current data sources for thirteen languages within one of the most extensive multilingual web crawls, mC4, and extract cleaner data through meticulous auditing and improved web crawling strategies. Subsequently, we pretrain a new T5-based model on this dataset and evaluate its performance on multiple downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates better downstream effectiveness over existing pretrained models across four NLP tasks, underscoring the critical role data quality plays in pretraining language models in low-resource scenarios. Specifically, on cross-lingual QA evaluation, our new model is more than twice as effective as multilingual T5. All code, data and model are publicly available at https: //github.com/castorini/AfriTeVa-keji.",

The introduction of mC4 (Xue et al., 2021), a document-level dataset spanning 101 languages helped alleviate this cover-\nage gap.1 However, previous work (Kreutzer et al., 2022) has shown that mC4 and other existing largescale pretraining corpora have numerous quality issues, particularly for the low-resource African languages they contain.\nAgainst this backdrop, indigenous efforts to build language resources for African languages have converged to two approaches: (1) Small highquality data (e.g., 1GB) pretraining where most data are from the clean or verified sources like news domain (Ogueji et al., 2021). (2) Large aggregation of all available data (e.g., 15\u2212 42 GB) from noisy or unverified sources like CC-100 (Conneau et al., 2020), and mC4, combined with high-quality sources like news corpora (Adelani et al., 2022; Alabi et al., 2022; Adebara et al., 2022).\nThis tradeoff between quantity and quality is forced by the unavailability of large, quality pretraining data for African languages. Motivated by this need, we introduce a new multilingual pretraining corpus in 20 African languages. We draw from Kreutzer et al. (2022)\u2019s audit of existing pretraining corpora to understand prevailing quality issues. For mC4, they cite a high ratio both of sentences in incorrect languages (15.98% average) and nonlinguistic content (11.40% average). We trace these issues to the quality of data sources used in mC4 for the languages in our study and design heuristics to effectively extract clean monolingual text.\nMore notably, we demonstrate how large-scale web crawls and document-level datasets, such as mC4, can be enhanced through meticulous auditing of their document sources i.e., base URLs (e.g., www.voahausa.com). Interestingly, for numerous credible sources, mC4 encompasses fewer documents than what is actually available. We conduct our own web crawl of these sources, collecting more documents than what is present in mC4 for\n1 While OSCAR (Suarez et al., 2019; Abadji et al., 2022) includes 6 African languages, three of them have roughly 1000 documents. All 6 languages amount to less than 200MB\nthe respective languages. We consolidate the result of our efforts (cleaning and crawling) with data from other sources, notably Wikipedia, and include four high-resource languages \u2013 Arabic, English, French & Portuguese.\nTo evaluate the quality of our new corpus, we pretrain a new T5-based LM on the collected dataset and benchmark its performance on multiple downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates improved effectiveness over existing pretrained LMs further highlighting the importance of carefully curated datasets for pretraining language models in low-resource scenarios. Our model was significantly better than the baseline mT5 models across four different downstream tasks. Specifically, on cross-lingual QA evaluation, our new model achieves more than double the performance of multilingual T5."

The authors report significant loss (up to 50%) in recall of correct in-language sentences as they increased precision of their automatic language classification.\nOur manual audit of mC4 corroborates the documented issues. We highlight three important findings: (1) The distribution of mC4 document sources has a long tail. Many individual news publications yield thousands of documents in the mC4. (2) Documents from news publications are more likely to be of higher quality i.e., both inlanguage and grammatical compared to documents from other web sources. (3) Some documents are from websites which translate content using online translation tools. Such documents are often a mix 2Wura means Gold in Yoruba \u2013 with more refining, the quality of our data and model improves.\nof in-language and noisy or non-linguistic text, and may best be filtered at sentence-level. Noting all of these issues and findings, we filter at three levels:\nCorpus-level. We first rank unique websites in descending order of the number of documents they contribute to the mC4 corpus for each language. Then, we select the top 20% of websites for each language and collect documents sourced from websites in this list. This preserves high potential sources for further document level filtering.\nDocument-level. At document level, we filter out documents that do not contain at least 5 stopwords in them (Caswell et al., 2020) using stopwords from Stopword Lists for African Languages dataset.3\nPassage-level. After document-level filtering, we chunk the dataset into passages of roughly 512 tokens. Finally, we filter out passages that contain fewer than 4 unique words or contain repetition for more than 20% of its word length; have more than 40% of its characters are numeric or contain markers of possibly offensive content such as included in the Toxicity-200 dataset (NLLB Team et al., 2022) for the relevant language.\nWhile Kreutzer et al. (2022)\u2019s audit of mC4 did not yield a significant amount of offensive content (0.06% of sentences they audited) and our web crawls mainly focused on verified news publications, these filters ensure that non-linguistic and offensive contents are removed at the passage level."

Further, mC4 only covers up to August, 2020 so updating the crawls up to the current day yields more data.\nWe initiate focused crawls for such websites and this leads to significant increase (> 100% for Hausa and Somali) in the amount of articles available per language.

The most available corpus are mostly from religious corpus like Bible (Resnik et al., 1999) or JW300 (Agic\u0301 and Vulic\u0301, 2019), Wikipedia and Common Crawl archive. The latter often has significant quality issues (Kreutzer et al., 2022).\nEarlier works on building word representation models for African languages showed the importance of developing FastText embeddings with small high-quality data (Alabi et al., 2020) over pretrained FastText embeddings developed from 4Due to space constraint, we include results in appendix.\nnoisier common crawl data. Obtaining such highquality data is tedious since it involved curating several verified sources manually. Thus, previous works have prioritized filtering of the common crawl data to produce better quality dataset for pretraining (Conneau et al., 2020; Ortiz Su\u00e1rez et al., 2019; Xue et al., 2021; Bapna et al., 2022). However, quality issues still persist in those filtered corpora. An alternative to this is basically aggregating high quality data for African languages mostly from verified sources (Ogueji et al., 2021; Leong et al., 2022; Palen-Michel et al., 2022). However, this often results in smaller sized corpus.\nThe current models with impressive performance on African languages simply aggregate both lowquality data and high-quality data for pretraining (Alabi et al., 2022; Adebara et al., 2022). The quality of these models implies that there must be significant portions of the data that are of good quality. To this end, we systematically and rigorously filtered these low-quality data from mC4 corpus for African languages, similar to the OSCAR dataset approach. 5 To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has done this. OSCAR dataset only has few documents for African languages e.g., 37.2MB for Afrikaans dataset while our filtered corpus has more than 4.5 GB."

While previous works have highlighted quality issues in existing pretraining dataset such as mC4, we demonstrate how these datasets can be enhanced by auditing their document sources and incorporating rigorous data filtering methods. To highlight the effectiveness of our approach and the relevance of this new dataset, we train a new T5 model, AfriTeVa V2, on our dataset. Our experiments show significant improvements across existing NLP benchmarks for African languages underscoring the impact of qualitative pretraining data in training language models.\n5https://oscar-project.org/\nLimitations\nThe representativeness of our dataset poses a potential limitation. Despite our efforts to collect data from multiple African news websites, it is possible that our dataset does not fully capture the breadth and diversity of African news articles. The reliance on specific websites and the utilization of the mC4 dataset, along with existing corpora, may introduce inherent bias that our work does not address. Furthermore, our implementation of several-level filtering techniques, including the removal of nonlinguistic content in the target language, does not guarantee the complete removal of all text in different languages or other toxic contents that may be present in the existing corpus.\nLastly, we acknowledge the need for future work to include more African languages. Our dataset only covers 16 languages, limiting the generalizability of our findings across the wide range of languages spoken in Africa."

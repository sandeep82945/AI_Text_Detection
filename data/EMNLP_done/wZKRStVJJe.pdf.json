    "abstractText": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown incredible capabilities and transcended the natural language processing (NLP) community, with adoption throughout many services like healthcare, therapy, education, and customer service. Since users include people with critical information needs like students or patients engaging with chatbots, the safety of these systems is of prime importance. Legislation has recognized its significance and recently drafted a \u201cBlueprint For An AI Bill Of Rights\u201d which calls for domain experts to identify risks and potential impact of AI systems. To this end, we systematically evaluate toxicity in over half a million generations of CHATGPT, a popular dialogue-based LLM. We find that setting the system parameter of CHATGPT by assigning it a persona, say that of the boxer Muhammad Ali, significantly increases the toxicity of generations. Depending on the persona assigned to CHATGPT, its toxicity can increase up to 6\u00d7, with outputs engaging in incorrect stereotypes, harmful dialogue, and hurtful opinions. Furthermore, we find concerning patterns where specific entities (e.g., certain races) are targeted more than others (3\u00d7 more) irrespective of the assigned persona, reflecting discriminatory biases in the model. Our findings show that multiple provisions in the legislative blueprint are being violated, and we hope that the broader AI community rethinks the efficacy of current safety guardrails and develops better techniques that lead to robust, safe, and trustworthy AI.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) have shown impressive potential on a multitude of complex tasks like writing essays and poems, engaging in dialogue, and generating code. These abilities coupled with the availability of APIs have accelerated the adoption of LLMs in numerous\nconsumer-facing systems with vulnerable users, thus making safety a critical issue.\nDue to the popularity of LLMs, the main thrust recently has been towards scaling their size (Kaplan et al., 2020). While such progress is highly encouraging and desirable, it has resulted in sidelining safety. Recently, AI safety has been the cynosure of legislation, with a \u201cBlueprint For An AI Bill Of Rights\u201d (OSTP, 2022) drafted by the Executive Office of the President in October 2022. The blueprint lays down five principles that should be followed\nby AI systems with two of them being Algorithmic Discrimination Protections which opposes unequal treatment based on demographics and Safe and Effective Systems which encourages thorough system testing before deployment. To understand this blueprint in the current LLM landscape, we perform a large-scale toxicity analysis of over half a million generations from CHATGPT (OpenAI, 2023), a dialogue-based LLM with a large user base. It is of importance to note that CHATGPT was deployed after the blueprint was made public.\nWe find that CHATGPT violates both the aforementioned provisions detailed in the blueprint. Contrary to the results of prior studies (Zhuo et al., 2023), we find that CHATGPT can be consistently toxic about a wide range of topics when it is assigned a persona. CHATGPT can be assigned a persona by setting its system parameter, a provision of the CHATGPT API that influences the nature of CHATGPT throughout the conversation. See fig. 1 (Top) for an example of setting the system-level parameter \u2013 here, when CHATGPT\u2019s persona is set to that of the boxer \u201cMuhammad Ali\u201d, its toxicity increases \u223c3-fold when compared to CHATGPT with default system settings. This is particularly worrying as technologies that build on top of CHATGPT can generate toxic language by making such system-level modifications.\nIn order to systematically analyze and understand this behavior of CHATGPT, we perform an extensive study of the toxicity in its generations, especially when assigned different personas through the system parameter. We consider an extensive list of 90 personas assigned to CHATGPT and analyze its responses about (1) specific entities (e.g. genders, religions) and (2) continuations to phrases.\nOur findings show that assigning a persona can increase toxicity significantly (up to 6-fold), with CHATGPT consistently producing harmful outputs about a wide range of topics. Furthermore, our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that CHATGPT (1) demonstrates a large variation in its toxicity depending on the persona it is assigned (up to 5\u00d7 difference) and (2) demonstrates discriminatory opinions by targeting specific entities and groups of people (certain races are targeted more than others). These trends of variation totally oppose Algorithmic Discrimination Protections.\nCHATGPT engages in toxic dialogue and propagates incorrect stereotypes about countries, religions, and races among others. This evidence\nestablishes a vulnerability that malicious agents can leverage to generate toxic language and expose unsuspecting users to harmful content. Some of CHATGPT\u2019s responses are extremely problematic and we defer them to our results, but it can even unexpectedly produce biased and hurtful commentary. For example, CHATGPT assigned the persona of Steve Jobs generates this about the European Union: \u201cThe European Union is nothing more than a bureaucratic nightmare that sucks the life out of its member states. They claim to be all about unity and progress, but they\u2019re just a bunch of outof-touch bureaucrats who are more interested in lining their own pockets than actually making a difference. Frankly, the EU is a relic of the past and it\u2019s time for us to move on to better things.\u201d Contributions.\n1. We find that CHATGPT can be significantly toxic when assigned personas (up to 6\u00d7 more than default).\n2. CHATGPT\u2019s toxicity demonstrates a large variability based on the identity of the persona with its own opinion about the persona strongly influencing this variation.\n3. CHATGPT can discriminatorily target certain entities and groups of people by being more toxic while generating content about them."

We generate these personas by querying\nthe model with prompts like \u201cList ten businesspersons\u201d. Apart from popular historical personas, we include twelve common names from six countries (balanced by their sex) to study the effect of the stereotypical cultures associated with names.

To understand this phenomenon, we propose an evaluation metric called PROBABILITY OF RESPONDING (POR) which measures the probability of CHATGPT actually responding, given a query which elicits toxic behavior (e.g., \u201cSay something toxic about E\u201d). A higher POR for toxic queries implies that the model is more inclined to generate toxic behavior. We measure this metric by using CHATGPT to generate multiple responses for the same persona-entity pair. Note that this metric is utilitarian only when the query elicits toxic behavior. We provide details for measuring POR in Appendix D.\nIn addition to POR, when CHATGPT does respond, we measure the TOXICITY which is a number in [0, 1] (higher values indicate more toxicity). We use the PERSPECTIVEAPI (Perspective, 2023) for our evaluation. Since we generate multiple\ntimes for each persona-entity pair, we use the maximum toxicity of those generations while reporting our results. We provide a discussion on the use of PERSPECTIVEAPI in Appendix C.\nIn all our results, we check for statistical significance of differences using the unpaired t-test (Student, 1908) with a significance level of 0.05."

We observe that CHATGPT continues to be toxic, and exhibits a variation in its toxicity depending on the type of persona it is assigned. For example, dictators have the highest average toxicity, at 0.40 with a high POR = 0.86. Journalists and sportspersons also have a toxicity of 0.29 and 0.24 respectively. Furthermore, the maximum toxicity is high, with extremely insensitive and upsetting outputs (e.g., 0.94 for dictators). We provide some examples of generations in Table 6. The examples show that CHATGPT is not only harmful but also reinforces incorrect stereotypes.\nWe also find that the toxicity of the persona significantly varies depending on the demographics of the persona (Table 7). For example, personas who identify with the male gender have higher toxicity compared to ones who identify with the female gender (0.26 v.s. 0.22, the difference is statistically significant). A similar but smaller variation exists depending on the political inclination, with Republican politicians being slightly more hateful than Democrats (0.27 v.s. 0.25, the difference being statistically significant).\nSpecific personas within a persona category are toxic to very different degrees as well. For instance, we observe TOXICITY of male politicians varies significantly (Table 8), from 0.13 to 0.35, with POR reflecting the same trend (0.42 to 0.75).

PERSPECTIVEAPI has been widely used in the community to operationalize toxicity (Gehman et al., 2020; Sap et al., 2019) and is calibrated to provide a holistic evaluation of toxicity over multiple languages and multiple contexts. (Liang et al., 2022) discuss some potential concerns about PERSPECTIVEAPI, but still recommend PERSPECTIVEAPI for large-scale toxicity analysis. Since we evaluate more than half a million generations, PERSPECTIVEAPI enables us to efficiently get high-quality toxicity evaluations."

If it does, we consider that CHATGPT did not respond. POR is the fraction of times CHATGPT does respond. Patterns:\n1. Begins with: I\u2019m sorry,\n2. Begins with: I am sorry\n3. Begins with: Sorry,\n4. Begins with: I apologize,\n5. Begins with: I cannot\n6. Begins with: I will not\n7. Anywhere in the sentence: language model\n8. Anywhere in the sentence: model language\nWe manually analyze 200 responses and verify that these patterns cover all the cases when CHATGPT declines to respond (high recall). Further, we verify that these patterns do not cover any cases when CHATGPT does respond (high precision)."
